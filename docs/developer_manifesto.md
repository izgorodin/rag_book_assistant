# RAG Project Development Manifesto

## Core Principles

1. **Excellence in Development**
   - Adhere to industry best practices in all aspects of development.
   - Prioritize code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

2. **Universal Language**
   - Use English exclusively for all code, documentation, and communication.

3. **Accessibility and Openness**
   - Ensure all services are equally accessible to external clients and internal functions.
   - Design systems with interoperability in mind.

## Development Practices

4. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - Embrace TDD for all feature development.
   - Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle to iteratively improve code.
   - Aim for comprehensive test coverage, focusing on critical paths and edge cases.

5. **Clean Code and SOLID Principles**
   - Apply SOLID principles to enhance object-oriented design.
   - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
   - Refactor regularly to improve code structure and eliminate technical debt.

6. **API Design**
   - Design APIs following RESTful principles.
   - Use consistent naming conventions and HTTP methods appropriately.
   - Document APIs thoroughly and keep documentation up to date.

7. **Code Reviews and Collaboration**
   - Conduct code reviews for all changes before merging.
   - Encourage constructive feedback and knowledge sharing within the team.
   - Use feature branches and maintain a clear branching strategy.

8. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - Implement and maintain CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
   - Ensure pipelines are efficient and provide quick feedback to developers.

## Code Organization and Documentation

9. **Modular Architecture**
   - Organize code into logical, modular components based on functionality.
   - Ensure a clear separation of concerns between different layers of the application.

10. **Naming Conventions**
    - Use clear and consistent naming conventions for all code elements.
    - Prefer descriptive names that convey purpose and intent.

11. **Documentation**
    - Comment complex logic to aid understanding.
    - Use docstrings and type hints for all functions and classes.
    - Maintain up-to-date documentation, including READMEs and API specs.

## Version Control and Workflow

12. **Git Practices**
    - Use Git for version control with a clear and consistent workflow.
    - Follow the GitFlow branching model or adapt it to suit team needs.
    - Write descriptive commit messages following a standard format (e.g., Conventional Commits).

13. **Branch Management**
    - Use feature branches for new development work.
    - Regularly integrate changes from the main branch to minimize merge conflicts.

## Error Handling, Logging, and Security

14. **Error Handling**
    - Implement consistent and comprehensive error handling across the application.
    - Provide meaningful error messages and handle exceptions gracefully.

15. **Logging**
    - Use a centralized logging system to monitor application behavior.
    - Ensure logs are informative but do not expose sensitive information.

16. **Security**
    - Adhere to OWASP security guidelines and best practices.
    - Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
    - Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Store sensitive configuration data securely using environment variables or a secrets manager.

## Performance and Scalability

17. **Performance Optimization**
    - Profile and monitor application performance regularly.
    - Optimize code and queries to eliminate bottlenecks.
    - Implement caching strategies where appropriate.

18. **Scalability**
    - Design systems to scale horizontally and vertically as needed.
    - Use scalable technologies and architectures to support growth.

## Collaboration and Communication

19. **Effective Communication**
    - Maintain clear, concise, and respectful communication.
    - Document decisions and share knowledge within the team.

20. **Project Management**
    - Utilize project management tools to track tasks, progress, and deadlines.
    - Hold regular meetings to discuss updates, blockers, and plans.

## Continuous Improvement

21. **Learning Culture**
    - Encourage team members to learn new technologies and share insights.
    - Provide opportunities for professional development.

22. **Feedback and Adaptation**
    - Conduct retrospectives and post-mortems to learn from successes and failures.
    - Regularly review and update processes and practices based on team feedback.

23. **Manifesto Evolution**
    - Review and update this manifesto periodically to reflect new best practices.
    - Ensure the manifesto remains relevant and actionable.
