But I would never have gotten anywhere without my mother helping me with my homework and smacking me when I wasnt ready to study, without my father telling me to be useful, without teachers who explained how to sell, or without coaches who taught me the fundamentals of weight lifting.

I knew I wanted to leave Austria, and I knew that America was exactly where I belonged, but Reg put fuel on the fire and gave me my blueprint. Joe Weider brought me to America and took me under his wing, promoting my bodybuilding career and teaching me about business. Lucille Ball took a huge chance and called me to guest star in a special that was my first big break in Hollywood. And in 2003, without the help of 4,206,284 Californians, I would never have been elected Governor of the great state of California. So how can I ever claim to be selfmade? To accept that mantle discounts every person and every piece of advice that got me here. And it gives the wrong impressionthat you can do it alone. I couldnt. And odds are, you cant either. We all need fuel. Without the assistance, advice, and inspiration of others, the gears of our mind grind to a halt, and were stuck with nowhere to go. I have been blessed to find mentors and idols at every step of my life, and Ive been lucky to meet many of them. From Joe Weider to Nelson Mandela, from Mikhail Gorbachev to Muhammad Ali, from Andy Warhol to George H.W. Bush, I have never been shy about seeking wisdom from others to pour fuel on my fire. You have probably listened to Tims podcasts. I particularly recommend the one with the charming bodybuilder with the Austrian accent. He has used his platform to bring you the wisdom of a diverse cast of characters in business, entertainment, and sports. I bet youve learned something from themand oftentimes, I bet you picked up something you didnt expect. Whether its a morning routine, or a philosophy or training tip, or just motivation to get through your day, there isnt a person on this planet who doesnt benefit from a little outside help. Ive always treated the world as my classroom, soaking up lessons and stories to fuel my path forward. I hope you do the same. The worst thing you can ever do is think that you know enough. Never stop learning. Ever. Thats why you bought this book. You know that wherever you are in life, there will be moments when you need outside motivation and insight. There will be times when you dont have the answer, or the drive, and youre forced to look beyond yourself. You can admit that you cant do it alone. I certainly cant. No one can. Now, turn the page and learn something. Arnold Schwarzenegger On the Shoulders of Giants I am not the expert. Im the experimenter, the scribe, and the guide. If you find anything amazing in this book, its thanks to the brilliant minds who acted as teachers, resources, critics, contributors, proofreaders, and references. If you find anything ridiculous in this book, its because I didnt heed their advice or made a mistake.

Big, undreamedof thingsthe people on the edge see them first. Kurt Vonnegut Routine, in an intelligent man, is a sign of ambition. W.H. Auden Im a compulsive notetaker. To wit, I have recorded nearly every workout since age 18 or so. Roughly 8 feet of shelf space in my home is occupied by spine upon spine of notebook upon notebook. That, mind you, is one subject. It extends to dozens. Some people would call this OCD, and many would consider it a manic wild goose chase. I view it simply It is the collection of my lifes recipes. My goal is to learn things once and use them forever. For instance, lets say I stumble upon a picture of myself from June 5, 2007, and I think, I really wish I looked like that again. No problem. Ill crack open a dusty volume from 2007, review the 8 weeks of training and food logs preceding June 5, repeat them, andvoilend up looking nearly the same as my younger self minus the hair. Its not always that easy, but it often is. This book, like my others, is a compendium of recipes for high performance that I gathered for my own use. Theres one big difference, thoughI never planned on publishing this one. As I write this, Im sitting in a caf in Paris overlooking the Luxembourg Garden, just off of Rue SaintJacques. Rue SaintJacques is likely the oldest road in Paris, and it has a rich literary history. Victor Hugo lived a few blocks from where Im sitting. Gertrude Stein drank coffee and F. Scott Fitzgerald socialized within a stones throw. Hemingway wandered up and down the sidewalks, his books percolating in his mind, wine no doubt percolating in his blood. I came to France to take a break from everything. No social media, no email, no social commitments, no set plans . . . except one project. The month had been set aside to review all of the lessons Id learned from nearly 200 worldclass performers Id interviewed on The Tim Ferriss Show, which recently passed 100,000,000 downloads. The guests included chess prodigies, movie stars, fourstar generals, pro athletes, and hedge fund managers. It was a motley crew. More than a handful of them had since become collaborators in business and creative projects, spanning from investments to indie film. As a result, Id absorbed a lot of their wisdom outside of our recordings, whether over workouts, wineinfused jam sessions, text message exchanges, dinners, or latenight phone calls. In every case, Id gotten to know them well beyond the superficial headlines in the media. My life had already improved in every area as a result of the lessons I could remember. But that was the tip of the iceberg. The majority of the gems were still lodged in thousands of pages of transcripts and handscribbled notes. More than anything, I longed for the chance to distill everything into a playbook. So, Id set aside an entire month for review and, if Im being honest, pain au chocolat, to put together the ultimate CliffsNotes for myself. It would be the notebook to end all notebooks. Something that could help me in minutes but be read for a lifetime. That was the lofty goal, at least, and I wasnt sure what the result would be. Within weeks of starting, the experience exceeded all expectations. No matter the situation I found myself in, something in this book was able to help. Now, when Im feeling stuck, trapped, desperate, angry, conflicted, or simply unclear, the first thing I do is flip through these pages with a strong cup of coffee in hand. So far, the needed medicine has popped out within 20 minutes of revisiting these friends, who will now become your friends. Need a reassuring pat on the back? Theres someone for that. An unapologetic slap in the face? Plenty of people for that, too. Someone to explain why your fears are unfounded . . . or why your excuses are bullshit? Done. There are a lot of powerful quotes, but this book is much more than a compilation of quotes. It is a toolkit for changing your life. There are many books full of interviews. This is different, because I dont view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I cant test something or replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, Im not interested. Everything in these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion. Ive used dozens of these tactics and philosophies in highstakes negotiations, highrisk environments, or large business dealings. The lessons have made me millions of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration. They work when you need them most. Some applications are obvious at first glance, while others are subtle and will provoke a Holy shit, now I get it! realization weeks later, while youre daydreaming in the shower or about to fall asleep. Many of the oneliners teach volumes. Some summarize excellence in an entire field in one sentence.

Done. There are a lot of powerful quotes, but this book is much more than a compilation of quotes. It is a toolkit for changing your life. There are many books full of interviews. This is different, because I dont view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I cant test something or replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, Im not interested. Everything in these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion. Ive used dozens of these tactics and philosophies in highstakes negotiations, highrisk environments, or large business dealings. The lessons have made me millions of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration. They work when you need them most. Some applications are obvious at first glance, while others are subtle and will provoke a Holy shit, now I get it! realization weeks later, while youre daydreaming in the shower or about to fall asleep. Many of the oneliners teach volumes. Some summarize excellence in an entire field in one sentence. As Josh Waitzkin page 577, chess prodigy and the inspiration behind Searching for Bobby Fischer, might put it, these bitesized learnings are a way to learn the macro from the micro. The process of piecing them together was revelatory. If I thought I saw the Matrix before, I was mistaken, or I was only seeing 10 of it. Still, even that 10islands of notes on individual mentorshad already changed my life and helped me 10x my results. But after revisiting more than a hundred minds as part of the same fabric, things got very interesting very quickly. For the movie nerds among you, it was like the end of The Sixth Sense or The Usual Suspects The red door knob! The fucking Kobayashi coffee cup! How did I not notice that?! It was right in front of me the whole time! To help you see the same, Ive done my best to weave patterns together throughout the book, noting where guests have complementary habits, beliefs, and recommendations. The completed jigsaw puzzle is much greater than the sum of its parts. What Makes These People Different? Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers. PierreMarcGaston These worldclass performers dont have superpowers. The rules theyve crafted for themselves allow the bending of reality to such an extent that it may seem that way, but theyve learned how to do this, and so can you. These rules are often uncommon habits and bigger questions. In a surprising number of cases, the power is in the absurd. The more absurd, the more impossible the question, the more profound the answers. Take, for instance, a question that serial billionaire Peter Thiel likes to ask himself and others If you have a 10year plan of how to get somewhere, you should ask Why cant you do this in 6 months? For purposes of illustration here, I might reword that to What might you do to accomplish your 10year goals in the next 6 months, if you had a gun against your head? Now, lets pause. Do I expect you to take 10 seconds to ponder this and then magically accomplish 10 years worth of dreams in the next few months? No, I dont. But I do expect that the question will productively break your mind, like a butterfly shattering a chrysalis to emerge with new capabilities. The normal systems you have in place, the social rules youve forced upon yourself, the standard frameworksthey dont work when answering a question like this. You are forced to shed artificial constraints, like shedding a skin, to realize that you had the ability to renegotiate your reality all along. It just takes practice. My suggestion is that you spend real time with the questions you find most ridiculous in this book. Thirty minutes of streamofconsciousness journaling page 224 could change your life. On top of that, while the world is a gold mine, you need to go digging in other peoples heads to unearth riches. Questions are your pickaxes and competitive advantage. This book will give you an arsenal to choose from. PerformanceEnhancing Details When organizing all of the material for myself, I didnt want an onerous 37step program. I wanted lowhanging fruit with immediate returns. Think of the bitesized rules within these pages as PEDsperformanceenhancing details. They can be added to any training regimen read here different careers, personal preferences, unique responsibilities, etc. to pour gasoline on the fire of progress. Fortunately, 10x results dont always require 10x effort. Big changes can come in small packages. To dramatically change your life, you dont need to run a 100mile race, get a PhD, or completely reinvent yourself. Its the small things, done consistently, that are the big things e.g., red teaming once per quarter, Tara Brachs guided meditations, strategic fasting or exogenous ketones, etc.. Tool is defined broadly in this book. It includes routines, books, common selftalk, supplements, favorite questions, and much more. What Do they Have in Common?

Some of the most encouraging workarounds are found in the outliers. I want you to look for the black sheep who fit your unique idiosyncrasies. Keep an eye out for the nontraditional paths, like Shay Carls journey from manual laborer to YouTube star to cofounder of a startup sold for nearly 1 billion page 441. The variation is the consistency. As a software engineer might say, Thats not a bug. Its a feature! Borrow liberally, combine uniquely, and create your own bespoke blueprint. This Book Is a BuffetHeres How to Get the Most Out of It Rule 1 Skip Liberally. I want you to skip anything that doesnt grab you. This book should be fun to read, and its a buffet to choose from. Dont suffer through anything. If you hate shrimp, dont eat the goddamn shrimp. Treat it as a chooseyourownadventure guide, as thats how Ive written it. My goal is for each reader to like 50, love 25, and never forget 10. Heres why For the millions whove heard the podcast, and the dozens who proofread this book, the 502510 highlights are completely different for every person. Its blown my mind. Ive even had multiple guests in this bookpeople who are the best at what they doproofread the same profile, answering my question of Which 10 would you absolutely keep, and which 10 would you absolutely cut? Oftentimes, the 10 must keep of one person was the exact must cut of someone else! This is not onesizefitsall. I expect you to discard plenty. Read what you enjoy. Rule 2 Skip, BUT do so intelligently. All that said, take a brief mental note of anything you skip. Perhaps put a little dot in the corner of the page or highlight the headline. Perhaps its skipping and glossing over precisely these topics or questions that has created blind spots, bottlenecks, and unresolved issues in your life? That was certainly true for me. If you decide to flip past something, note it, return to it later at some point, and ask yourself, Why did I skip this? Did it offend you? Seem beneath you? Seem too difficult? And did you arrive at that by thinking it through, or is it a reflection of biases inherited from your parents and others? Very often, our beliefs are not our own. This type of practice is how you create yourself, instead of seeking to discover yourself. There is value in the latter, but its mostly pasttense Its a rearview mirror. Looking out the windshield is how you get where you want to go. Just Remember Two Principles I was recently standing in Place Louis Aragon, a shaded outdoor nook on the River Seine, having a picnic with writing students from the Paris American Academy. One woman pulled me aside and asked what I hoped to convey in this book, at the core. Seconds later, we were pulled back into the fray, as the attendees were all taking turns talking about the circuitous paths that brought them there that day. Nearly everyone had a story of wanting to come to Paris for yearsin some cases, 30 to 40 yearsbut assuming it was impossible. Listening to their stories, I pulled out a scrap of paper and jotted down my answer to her question. In this book, at its core, I want to convey the following Success, however you define it, is achievable if you collect the right fieldtested beliefs and habits. Someone else has done your version of success before, and often, many have done something similar. But, you might ask, what about a first, like colonizing Mars? There are still recipes. Look at empire building of other types, look at the biggest decisions in the life of Robert Moses read The Power Broker, or simply find someone who stepped up to do great things that were deemed impossible at the time e.g., Walt Disney. There is shared DNA you can borrow. The superheroes you have in your mind idols, icons, titans, billionaires, etc. are nearly all walking flaws whove maximized 1 or 2 strengths. Humans are imperfect creatures. You dont succeed because you have no weaknesses you succeed because you find your unique strengths and focus on developing habits around them. To make this crystalclear, Ive deliberately included two sections in this book pages 197 and 616 that will make you think Wow, Tim Ferriss is a mess. How the hell does he ever get anything done?

A Few Important Notes on Format Structure This book is comprised of three sections Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise. Of course, there is tremendous overlap across the sections, as the pieces are interdependent. In fact, you could think of the three as a tripod upon which life is balanced. One needs all three to have any sustainable success or happiness. Wealthy, in the context of this book, also means much more than money. It extends to abundance in time, relationships, and more. My original intention with The 4Hour Workweek 4HWW, The 4Hour Body 4HB, and The 4Hour Chef 4HC was to create a trilogy themed after Ben Franklins famous quote Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. People constantly ask me, What would you put in The 4Hour Workweek if you were to write it again? How would you update it? Ditto for 4HB and 4HC. Tools of Titans contains most of the answers for all three. Extended quotes Before writing this book, I called Mason Currey, author of Daily Rituals, which profiles the rituals of 161 creatives like Franz Kafka and Pablo Picasso. I asked him what his best decisions were related to the book. Mason responded with, I let my subjects voices come through as much as possible, and I think that was one of things that I did right. Often, it wasnt the details of their routinehabits, so much as how they talked about them that was interesting. This is a critical observation and exactly why most books of quotes fail to have any real impact. Take, for example, a oneliner like Whats on the other side of fear? Nothing. from Jamie Foxx. Its memorable, and you might guess at the profound underlying meaning. Id still wager youd forget it within a week. But, what if I made it infinitely more powerful by including Jamies own explanation of why he uses that maxim to teach his kids confidence? The context and original language teaches you how to THINK like a worldclass performer, not just regurgitate quotes. That is the key metaskill were aiming for. To that end, youll see a lot of extended quotes and stories. Ive occasionally bolded lines within quotes. This is my emphasis, not the guests. How to Read QuotesThe Micro . . . Portion of dialogue omitted words in brackets additional information that wasnt part of the interview but may be necessary to understand whats being discussed, or related info or recommendations from yours truly How to Read QuotesThe Macro One of my podcast guests, also one of the smartest people I know, was shocked when I showed him his raw transcript. Wow, he said. I generally like to think of myself as a decently smart guy, but I use past, present, and future tense like theyre the same fucking thing. It makes me sound like a complete moron. Transcripts can be unforgiving. Ive read my own, so I know how bad it can be. In the heat of the moment, grammar can go out the window, to be replaced by false starts and sentence fragments. Everyone starts an ungodly number of sentences with And or So. I and millions of others tend to use and I was like instead of and I said. Many of us mix up plural and singular. This all works fine in conversation, but it can hiccup on the printed page. Quotations have therefore been edited in some cases for clarity, space, and as a courtesy to guests and readers alike. I did my best to preserve the spirit and point of quotes, while making them as smart and readable as possible. Sometimes I keep it fast and loose to preserve the kinetic energy and emotion of the moment. Other times, I smooth out the edges, including my own stammering. If anything sounds silly or off, assume it was my mistake. Everyone in this book is amazing, and Ive done my best to showcase that. Patterns Where guests have related recommendations or philosophies, Ive noted them in parentheses. For instance, if Jane Doe tells a story about the value of testing higher prices, I might add see Marc Andreessen, page 170, since his answer to If you could have a billboard anywhere, what would you put on it? was Raise prices, which he explains in depth. Humor! Ive included ample doses of the ridiculous. First of all, if were serious all the time, well wear out before we get the truly serious stuff done. Second, if this book were all stern looks and no winks, all productivity and no grabassing, youd remember very little. I agree with Tony Robbins page 210 that information without emotion isnt retained.

Sometimes I keep it fast and loose to preserve the kinetic energy and emotion of the moment. Other times, I smooth out the edges, including my own stammering. If anything sounds silly or off, assume it was my mistake. Everyone in this book is amazing, and Ive done my best to showcase that. Patterns Where guests have related recommendations or philosophies, Ive noted them in parentheses. For instance, if Jane Doe tells a story about the value of testing higher prices, I might add see Marc Andreessen, page 170, since his answer to If you could have a billboard anywhere, what would you put on it? was Raise prices, which he explains in depth. Humor! Ive included ample doses of the ridiculous. First of all, if were serious all the time, well wear out before we get the truly serious stuff done. Second, if this book were all stern looks and no winks, all productivity and no grabassing, youd remember very little. I agree with Tony Robbins page 210 that information without emotion isnt retained. Look up von Restorff effect and primacy and recency effect for more science, but this book has been deliberately constructed to maximize your retention. Which leads us to . . . Spirit animals Yes, spirit animals. There wasnt room for photographs in this book, but I wanted some sort of illustrations to keep things fun. It seemed like a lost cause, but thenafter a glass or four of wineI recalled that one of my guests, Alexis Ohanian page 194, likes to ask potential hires, Whats your spirit animal? Eureka! So, youll see thumbnail spirit animals for anyone who would humor me and play along. The best part? Dozens of people took the question very seriously. Extended explanations, emotional changes of heart, and Venn diagrams ensued. Questions poured in Would a mythological creature be acceptable? Can I be a plant instead? Alas, I couldnt get a hold of everyone in time for publication, so drawings are sprinkled throughout like Scooby snacks. In a book full of practicality, treat these like little rainbows of absurdity. People had fun with it. Nonprofile content and Tim Ferriss chapters In all sections, there are multiple nonprofile pieces by guests and yours truly. These are typically intended to expand upon key principles and tools mentioned by multiple people. URLs, websites, and social media Ive omitted most URLs, as outdated URLs are nothing but frustrating for everyone. For nearly anything mentioned, assume that Ive chosen wording that will allow you to find it easily on Google or Amazon. All full podcast episodes can be found at fourhourworkweek.compodcast. Just search the guests name, and the extended audio, complete show notes, links, and resources will pop up like warm toast on a cold morning. In nearly every guests profile, I indicate where you can best interact with them on social media TW Twitter, FB Facebook, IG Instagram, SC Snapchat, and LI LinkedIn. Your SendoffThe 3 Tools that Allow All the Rest Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse is recommended by many guests in this book. There is one specific takeaway that Naval Ravikant page 546 has reinforced with me several times on our long walks over coffee. The protagonist, Siddhartha, a monk who looks like a beggar, has come to the city and falls in love with a famous courtesan named Kamala. He attempts to court her, and she asks, What do you have? A wellknown merchant similarly asks, What can you give that you have learned? His answer is the same in both cases, so Ive included the latter story here. Siddhartha ultimately acquires all that he wants. Merchant . . . If you are without possessions, how can you give? Siddhartha Everyone gives what he has. The soldier gives strength, the merchant goods, the teacher instruction, the farmer rice, the fisherman fish. Merchant Very well, and what can you give? What have you learned that you can give? Siddhartha I can think, I can wait, I can fast. Merchant Is that all? Siddhartha I think that is all. Merchant And of what use are they? For example, fasting, what good is that? Siddhartha It is of great value, sir. If a man has nothing to eat, fasting is the most intelligent thing he can do. If, for instance, Siddhartha had not learned to fast, he would have had to seek some kind of work today, either with you, or elsewhere, for hunger would have driven him. But, as it is, Siddhartha can wait calmly. He is not impatient, he is not in need, he can ward off hunger for a long time and laugh at it. I think of Siddharthas answers often and in the following terms I can think Having good rules for decisionmaking, and having good questions you can ask yourself and others. I can wait Being able to plan longterm, play the long game, and not misallocate your resources. I can fast Being able to withstand difficulties and disaster. Training yourself to be uncommonly resilient and have a high pain tolerance. This book will help you to develop all three.

Since the inception of the sport, shes amassed more than 30 victories and 50 podiums. In the 2012 Worlds Toughest Mudder competition, which lasts 24 hours she covered 90 miles and 300 obstacles, she finished second OVERALL out of more than 1,000 competitors, 80 of whom were male. The one person who beat her finished just 8 minutes ahead of her. Her major victories include the Spartan Race World Championship and the Spartan Race Elite Point Series, and she is the only threetime winner of the Worlds Toughest Mudder 2012, 2014, and 2015. She won the 2014 championship 8 weeks after knee surgery. Amelia is also a threetime finisher of the Death Race, a fulltime attorney at Apple, and she dabbles in ultra running qualified for the Western States 100 in all of her spare time.

Mostgifted or recommended book House of Leaves by Mark Danielewski This is a book that you have to hold, because there are parts of it where you need to turn it upside down to read it. There are certain pages where, you are reading it, and it turns in a circle. . . . This is a book thats an entire sensory experience. Amelias Tips and Tactics Hydrolyzed gelatin beet root powder Ive consumed gelatin for connective tissue repair in the past. Ive never stuck with it long term because gelatin takes on a seagull poolike texture when mixed into cold water. Amelia saved my palate and joints by introducing me to the Great Lakes hydrolyzed version green label, which blends easily and smoothly. Add a tablespoon of beet root powder like BeetElite to stave off any cowhoof flavor, and its a whole new game. Amelia uses BeetElite prerace and pretraining for its endurance benefits, but Im much hardercore I use it to make tart, lowcarb gummy bears when fat Tim has carb cravings. RumbleRoller Think foam roller meets monstertruck tire. Foam rollers have historically done very little for me, but this torture device had an immediate positive impact on my recovery. It also helps you sleep if used before bed. Warning Start slow. I tried to copy Amelia and did 20plus minutes my first session. The next day, I felt like Id been put in a sleeping bag and swung against a tree for a few hours. Rolling your foot on top of a golf ball on the floor to increase hamstring flexibility. This is infinitely more helpful than a lacrosse ball. Put a towel on the floor underneath the golf ball, lest you shoot your dogs eye out. Concept2 SkiErg for training when your lower body is injured. After knee surgery, Amelia used this lowimpact machine to maintain cardiovascular endurance and prepare for the 2014 Worlds Toughest Mudder, which she won 8 weeks postop. Kelly Starrett page 122 is also a big fan of this device. Dry needling Id never heard of this before meeting Amelia. In acupuncture the goal is not to feel the needle. In dryneedling, you are sticking the needle in the muscle belly and trying to get it to twitch, and the twitch is the release. Its used for supertight, overcontracted muscles, and the needles are not left in. Unless youre a masochist, dont have this done on your calves. Sauna for endurance Amelia has found using a sauna improves her endurance, a concept that has since been confirmed by several other athletes, including cyclist David Zabriskie, seventime U.S. National Time Trial Championship winner. He considers sauna training a more practical replacement for highaltitude simulation tents. In the 2005 Tour de France, Dave won the Stage 1 time trial, making him the first American to win stages in all three Grand Tours. Zabriskie beat Lance Armstrong by seconds, clocking an average speed of 54.676 kilometers per hour !. I now use a sauna at least four times per week. To figure out the best protocols, I asked another podcast guest, Rhonda Patrick. Her response is on page 7. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful?

She is a gifted a cappella singer and was part of the Greenleafs group at Washington University in St. Louis. Spirit animal Coywolf Rhonda Perciavalle Patrick Rhonda Perciavalle Patrick, PhD TWFBIG foundmyfitness, foundmyfitness.com has worked alongside notables including Dr. Bruce Ames, the inventor of the Ames mutagenicity test and the 23rd mostcited scientist across all fields between 1973 and 1984. Dr. Patrick also conducts clinical trials, performed aging research at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, and did graduate research at St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital, where she focused on cancer, mitochondrial metabolism, and apoptosis. More recently, Dr. Patrick has published papers on a mechanism by which vitamin D is able to regulate the production of serotonin in the brain and the various implications this may have for earlylife deficiency and relevance for neuropsychiatric disorders. The Tooth Fairy Might Save Your Life Or Your Kids lives Dr. Patrick introduced me to using teeth for stemcell banking. If you are having your wisdom teeth removed, or if your kids are losing their baby teeth which have a particularly high concentration of dental pulp stem cells, consider using a company like StemSave or National Dental Pulp Laboratory to preserve them for later use. These companies will send your oral surgeon a kit, and then freeze the biological matter using liquid nitrogen. Costs vary, but are roughly 625 for setup and then 125 per year for storage and maintenance. Mesenchymal stem cells can later be harvested from the dental pulp of teeth for useful e.g., bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessels, etc., lifechanging e.g., motor neurons for repairing damaged spinal cord, or potentially lifesaving e.g., traumatic brain injury treatments using your own biological raw materials. Heat Is the New Black Hyperthermic conditioning calculated heat exposure can help you to increase growth hormone GH levels and substantially improve endurance. I now take 20minute sauna sessions postworkout or poststretching at least four times per week, typically at roughly 160 to 170F. If nothing else, it seems to dramatically decrease DOMS delayedonset muscle soreness. Focusing on endurance and growth hormone, here are some observations from Dr. Patrick One study has demonstrated that a 30minute sauna session twice a week for 3 weeks postworkout increased the time it took for study participants to run until exhaustion by 32 compared to baseline. The 32 increase in running endurance found in this particular study was accompanied by a 7.1 increase in plasma volume and 3.5 increase in red blood cell count. Two 20minute sauna sessions at 80C 176F separated by a 30minute cooling period elevated growth hormone levels twofold over baseline. Whereas, two 15minute dryheat sessions at 100C 212F separated by a 30minute cooling period resulted in a fivefold increase in growth hormone. . . . The growth hormone effects generally persist for a couple of hours postsauna. TF Hot baths can also significantly increase GH over baseline, and both sauna and hot baths have been shown to cause a massive release in prolactin, which plays a role in wound healing.

I push a few minutes past dynorphin release, which usually makes one feel dysphoric and want to get out but not to dizziness or lightheadedness.

During his extensive 40year coaching career, Coach Sommer took meticulous notes on his training techniqueshis wins and failuresso that he could translate the best elements into a superior exercise system for both highlevel and beginner athletes. His four decades of careful observation led to the birth of Gymnastics Strength Training GST. Back Story The combination of GST and AcroYoga page 52 has completely remodeled my body in the last year. Im more flexible and mobile at age 39 than I was at age 20. Im going to skip explaining a lot e.g., Maltese, Stalder press handstand that is best seen in video or pictures, though Ill describe the most critical starting on page 53. Google is your friend. On Working on Your Weaknesses If you want to be a stud later, you have to be a pud now. Coach first told me this when I was complaining about slow progress with shoulder extension imagine clasping your hands together behind your back, arms straight, then raising your arms without bending at the waist. When in doubt, work on the deficiencies youre most embarrassed by. My biggest weaknesses are shoulder extension and bridging using the thoracic spine versus lowerback arch. After improving them 10 over 3 to 4 weeksgoing from making coach vomit to merely making coach laugha host of physical issues that plagued me for years completely disappeared. To assess your biggest weaknesses, start by finding a Functional Movement Screen FMS near you. Related from Sommer Youre not responsible for the hand of cards you were dealt. Youre responsible for maxing out what you were given. Flexibility Versus Mobility Sommers distinction between flexibility and mobility is the most concrete and clear Ive heard. Flexibility can be passive, whereas mobility requires that you can demonstrate strength throughout the entire range of motion, including the end ranges. See the Jcurl and pike pulse exercises on pages 15 and 18 for two examples of mobility, which can be also be thought of as active flexibility. The pike pulse is a particularly clear demonstration, as it tests compression strength in a range that most people never experience. Consistency over Intensity Slow down. Wheres the fire? This is Coachs constant reminder that certain adaptations take weeks or months of consistent stimuli see page 160. If you rush, the reward is injuries. In GST, there are surprising stair steps after long periods of zero progress. Roughly six months into doing his hamstring series with minor gains, I seemingly doubled my max ranges overnight. This was completely unsurprising to Sommer. I used to tell my athletes there are stupid gymnasts, and there are old gymnasts, but there are no old, stupid gymnasts because theyre all dead. Diet and Exercise Eat and Train Coach Sommer dislikes the fitness fixation on diet and exercise. He finds it much more productive to focus on eat and train. One is aesthetic, and the other is functional. The former may not have a clear goal, the latter always does. They Failed Warmup! Coach describing his firstever seminar for nongymnast adults, in roughly 2007 Weve got all of these beasts there advanced lifters, and theyre strong. I tried to do my entrylevel plyometric group work and some floor work with them. The stronger the athlete, the faster they went down knees, lower back, ankles . . . from baby stuff. Were not talking anything hard. Were talking about standing in place, and, with knees straight, being able to bounce down the floor using just your calves. No way. Their tissues couldnt take it. They hadnt done anything like it. To show you how bad mobility was, we had 15 minutes on the schedule to stretch. Nothing intricate, nothing intensejust an easy, basic stretch. Get them loosened up for the day. That stretch took an hour and a half to complete. There were bodies lying everywhere. It was like I was in Vietnam or filming a war movie. I turned to my staff, and Im like, What the fuck am I supposed to do now? They failed warmup. They failed warmup. Why Those Olympic Boys Have Gigantic Biceps Male Olympic gymnasts dont have biceps the size of their waists from curls. It comes largely from straightarm work, especially Maltese work on rings. But how on earth can you practice a Maltese as a novice? I use a 5050 pulley system to cut my bodyweight resistance in half, which is similar to the Ring Thing Power Monkey Fitness or generic dream machine that Jason Nemer page 46 loves using. I combine this with power levers, strapon metal gauntlets that allow me to attach the ring ropes to my forearms anywhere between the elbow and the fist. This allows me to use progressive resistance, starting near the elbow and moving out to the hand. The best versions are currently only available in Europe, but there are vaguely similar iron cross trainers available in the U.S. 3 Movements Everyone Should Practice JCurl page 15 Shoulder Extension Lift a dowel behind your back standing, or sit on the floor and walk your hands backward behind your hips.

Good Goals for Adult NonGymnasts The following goals incorporate many different aspects of strength and mobility into single movements Beginner JCurl Intermediate Straddle Press Handstand TF Im working on this Advanced Stalder Press Handstand Sometimes, You Just Need a Vibrator Coach Sommer introduced me to a Russian medical massage specialist who recommended I use the plugin not cordless model of the Hitachi Magic Wand on its high setting. Ive never experienced such heights of ecstasy. Thanks, Vladmir! Just kidding. In this case, its for relaxing hypertonic muscles i.e., muscles that are tense even though they shouldnt be. Just place the wand on your muscle belly not insertion points for 20 to 30 seconds, which is often all it takes at the proper hertz. Tension headaches or a stiff neck? Its great for relaxing the occipitals at the base of the skull. Warning Having Hitachi Magic Wands lying out around your house can go terribly wrongor terribly right. Good luck explaining your hypertonic muscles. As one friend said to me, I think my wife has that same problem. . . . Gymnast Strong Unusual and Effective Bodyweight Exercises In less than eight weeks of following Coach Sommers protocols, I saw unbelievable improvement in areas Id largely given up on. Try a few of my favorite exercises, and youll quickly realize that gymnasts use muscles you didnt even know you had. QL WalkAn Unusual Warmup Coach Sommer borrowed this exercise from power lifter Donnie Thompson, who calls it the butt walk. Donnie Super D Thompson is the first person to hit a power lifting total of more than 3,000 pounds bench press deadlift squat. The QL walk is intended to get your glutes and quadratus lumborum QL firing, the latter of which Donnie calls an angry troll in your back Sit down on a mat or gravel, if you want to turn your ass into hamburger meat. Legs are extended in front of you, ankles can be touching or slightly apart, and your back should be straight. I keep legs together. This is pike position, which Ill refer to quite a bit in this book. Lift a kettlebell or dumbbell to your collarbones think front squat. I weigh 170 pounds and use 30 to 60 pounds. I hold the kettlebell horns, but Donnie prefers to support it from underneath. Keeping your legs straight no bend at the knee, walk your butt cheeksleft, right, left, rightacross the floor. I typically go 10 to 15 feet. Reverse direction and go backward 10 to 15 feet. Thats it. Jefferson Curl JCurl Think of this as a controlled, slowly rounded, stifflegged deadlift. From Sommer Progress slowly and patiently. Do not rush. For this type of loaded mobility work, never allow yourself to strain, grind out reps, or force range of motion. Smooth, controlled movement is the order of the day. The ultimate goal is body weight on a bar, but start with 15 pounds. I currently use only 50 to 60 pounds. This can perform miracles for thoracic, or midback, mobility, all while helping the hamstrings in the pike position. When I asked Coach Sommer how often I should do these, he said, We do these like breathing. In other words, at a minimum, JCurls are done at the beginning of every primary workout. Begin by standing up straight, legs locked, holding a bar waisthigh with your arms shoulder width apart. fig. A Think deadlift top position. Tuck your chin tightly against your chest keep it tucked for the entire movement and slowly bend over, one vertebra at a time, from the neck down. fig. B Keep your arms straight and the bar close to your legs. Lower until you cant stretch any farther. As you become more flexible, stand on a box I use a Rogue plyo box, with the goal of passing your wrists below your toes. Keep your legs as perpendicular to the ground as possible, and try to not push your hips back until your head is below your waist. Slowly stand back up, rolling one vertebra at a time. Your chin should be the last thing to come up. fig. C Thats 1 rep. Repeat for a total of 5 to 10 reps. Dips with RTO Ring Turn Out So you can do 10 to 20 regular dips? Fantastic. I challenge you to do 5 slow dips on rings with proper turnout at the top support position. Imagine the lines of the knuckles pointing to 10 and 2 oclock at the apex.

Hinge Rows This is an excellent lowrisk option for smashing your midtraps and external rotator cuff muscles, which are used for handstands and just about everything in gymnastics. Visualize popping up like Dracula in a coffin, then hitting a double bicep pose. The catch Your hands are holding rings the entire time.

Get some furniture sliders 5 to 15. These look like drink coasters and are used to move furniture around without scratching the floor. Sit down in pike position and put your heels on the furniture sliders which I now always pack for travel workouts. Put your hands on the floor by your hips andarms straightlift your hips off the ground. Try to make your body perfectly straight from shoulder to heel, just as in the hinge rows. Easy? Now walk forward with your hands, pushing your feet along the floor. This can be done forward and backward. Aim for 5 minutes of constant movement, but feel free to start with 60 seconds youll see. Pro tip This is a great way to freak people out when done at 2 a.m. in hotel hallways. Pike Pulses When one of my meathead friends is laughing at my GST exercises, I have them attempt this. It usually ends with a head shake and a puzzled Holy fuck. Sit in pike position in the middle of the floor. Point your toes and keep your knees locked. Walk your hands out on the floor, as far toward or past your feet as you can. Now, try to lift your heels 1 to 4 inches, which is 1 repetition or pulse. For 99 of you, this will be completely impossible and youll feel like an ice statue. Ratchet back and put your hands midway between hip and knee. See how you do and then move your hands forward enough to allow only 15 to 20 pulses. If you did really well, now try it with your lower back against a wall. What happened?! Sorry, killer, you werent actually pulsing, you were rocking back and forth like a cradle. Do it against the wall to keep yourself honest. Cast Wall Walk If you have no gymnastics background, this one will be funterrible. I use cast wall walks as a workout finisher and recommend you do the same, as youll be worthless afterward. First, lets define the position you need to maintain. Torso Hollow Sit on a chair, back straight, with your hands on your knees. Now, try to bring your sternum chest bone to your belly button shorten your torso by 3 to 4 inches by contracting and pulling in your abs. Youll maintain this position throughout the entire exercise. No lowerback arch or sag permitted. Shoulders Protracted Keep your torso hollow per the above. Now, pretend youre hugging a telephone pole. Your shoulders should be well in front of your chest, sternum pulled back strongly. Straighten your arms but maintain this position. Next, without losing any of the aforementioned, lift your arms overhead as high as you can. There you go. Now we can begin. Get into a handstand position against a wall, nose facing toward the wall. fig. A Keeping your body in one line, slowly walk your hands out and your feet down the wall simultaneously. fig.

He has also deadlifted 500 pounds for 10 reps after a 7day fast. Hes a beast andno big surprisehes a good buddy of Dr. Peter Attia, my MD friend page 59 who consumed jet fuel in search of optimal athletic performance. The primary focus of Doms laboratory is developing and testing metabolic therapies, including ketogenic diets, ketone esters, and ketone supplements to induce nutritionaltherapeutic ketosis, and lowtoxicity metabolicbased drugs. Much of his work is related to metabolic therapies and nutritional strategies for peak performance and resilience in extreme environments. His research is supported by the Office of Naval Research, Department of Defense, private organizations, and foundations. LittleKnown Facts Back around 1995, Dom gifted Tony Robbinss page 210 Personal Power audio set to all of his undergrad lifting buddies. Two contacted him years later to thank him for changing their lives. After my first podcast with Dom, Whole Foods Markets around the country sold out of Wild Planet canned sardines. Preface This profile is one of several that might save your life, and it has certainly changed mine. As such, it deviates from the usual format to act as more of a miniprimer on all things ketosis. There is a lot of diet talk, but the supplements and fasting can be treated as separate toolsno bacon or heavy cream required. For ease of reading, some of the concepts are slightly simplified for a lay audience. My current personal regimen is included. First, Some Basics The ketogenic diet, often nicknamed keto, is a highfat diet that mimics fasting physiology. Your brain and body begin to use ketones derived from stored or ingested fat for energy instead of blood sugar glucosea state called ketosis. The diet was originally developed to treat epileptic children, but there are many variations, including the Atkins diet. You can achieve ketosis through fasting, diet, exogenous ketones, or a combination. How do you know when youre in ketosis? The most reliable way is to use a device called the Precision Xtra by Abbott. This can measure both glucose and blood levels of betahydroxybutyrate BHB. Once you reach 0.5 mmolmillimolars, a concentrationyou can consider yourself lightly in ketosis. I tend to feel increased mental clarity at 1 mmol or higher. The primary resource, as youll come back to this Doms top goto resource for the ketogenic diet, including FAQs, meal plans, and more is ketogenicdietresource.com. I like to promote mild to moderate ketosis for health and longevity, which is between 1 to 3 mmol. TF These levels help protect DNA from damage, among other benefits. Why Consider Ketosis or Supplemental Ketones? Fat loss and body recomposition Potent anticancer effects Better use of oxygen Dom can hold his breath for two times his normal duration when in deep ketosis 2 minutes 4 minutes. I observed the same. Essentially, you can derive more energy per oxygen molecule with ketone metabolism. This oxygen utilization advantage is why some elite cyclists are experimenting with keto. This also helps performance at high altitudes, if youre going from sea level to mountains, for instance. Maintain or increase strength In a study with 12 subjects, Dom demonstrated that even advanced weight lifters could maintain or increase strength, performance, and hypertrophy after 2 weeks of ketoadaptation, consuming 75 to 80 of calories from fat supplemented with MCT and coconut oils and restricting carbohydrates to 22 to 25 g per day. Ketones have an anticatabolic proteinsparing and antiinflammatory effect. Lyme disease Caveat This is a personal experience, not a doubleblind study. Reaching deep ketosis for me, 3 to 6 mmol through fasting, then continuing with calorierestricted keto for a week, completely eradicated symptoms of Lyme disease when all else failed. It was the only thing that helped after my first course of antibiotics. It produced a nightandday difference a 10time improvement in my mental performance and clarity. I suspect this relates to mitochondrial rehab and the antiinflammatory effects of ketones. More than a year has passed and the symptoms have not returned, despite following the nonketogenic SlowCarb Diet see page 81 90 of the time. Why Consider Fasting?

Dom has discussed the idea of a therapeutic purge fast with his colleague Dr. Thomas Seyfried of Boston College. Per Dom If you dont have cancer and you do a therapeutic fast 1 to 3 times per year, you could purge any precancerous cells that may be living in your body. If youre over the age of 40, cancer is one of the four types of diseases see Dr. Peter Attia on page 59 that will kill you with 80 certainty, so this seems like smart insurance. There is also evidence to suggestskipping the scientific detailthat fasts of 3 days or longer can effectively reboot your immune system via stem cellbased regeneration. Dom suggests a 5day fast 2 to 3 times per year. Dom has done 7day fasts before, while lecturing at the University of South Florida. On day 7, he went into class with his glucose between 35 and 45 mgdL, and his ketones around 5 mmol. Then, before breaking the fast, he went to the gym and deadlifted 500 pounds for 10 reps, followed by 1 rep of 585 pounds. Dom was inspired to do his first 7day fast by George Cahill, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, whod conducted a fascinating study published in 1970 wherein he fasted people for 40 days. Fasting doesnt need to make you miserable and weak. In fact, it can have quite the opposite effect. But lets start with how not to do it. . . . Some Personal Background I did my first extended fast as a last resort. Lyme disease had decimated me and put me at 10 capacity for nearly 9 months. My joints hurt so much that it took 5 to 10 minutes to get out of bed, and my shortterm memory worsened to the point that I began to forget good friends names. Adding inputs e.g., drugs, IV treatments, etc. didnt seem to help, so I decided to try removing all inputs, including food. I did my homework, found the bestreviewed fasting clinics in the U.S., and headed off. My first 7day fast was excruciating. It was medically supervised at a clinic, where we also had room and board. Patients were permitted to consume nothing but distilled water. Tap water, toothpaste, and even bathing were advised against. No exercise or leaving the facility were permitted for liability reasons. From days 3 to 4, my lower back pain was so extreme that I remained on my bed in the fetal position. The doctors told me this was toxins being released, which I didnt accept. I insisted on blood testing instead, and the explanation for the lowerback pain was simple My kidneys were getting hammered by skyhigh uric acid levels. I wasnt allowed to exercise not even brisk walking, so it was taking forever to get into ketosis. My body was breaking down muscle tissue so the liver could convert it into glucose, and uric acid was a byproduct. On top of this, since patients were limited to distilled water, nearly all the fasters about 40 in total couldnt sleep due to electrolyte depletion and subsequent cholinergic responses e.g., rapid heart rate when trying to sleep. Nonetheless, I noticed benefits Longstanding skin issues disappeared after a few days, as did chronic joint pain. On the morning of day 7, I woke up to blood spilling out of my mouthguard. I had been dreaming of strawberry shortcake seriously and chewed the fucker so hard that my gums split open. Basta. I broke my fast with stewed porkagainst doctors ordersand decided two things Fasting was very interesting, but this wasnt how I would do it. Wait . . . So Whats the Fasting You Practice? In the last 2 years, Ive done a lot of fasting experiments, focusing on real science instead of old wives tales e.g., you must break your fast with shredded cabbage and beets. I now aim for a 3day fast once per month and a 5 to 7day fast once per quarter. I would like to do one 14 to 30day fast per year, but the logistics have proven too inconvenient. The longest fast Ive done to date was 10 days. During that fast, I added vitamin C IVs and hyperbaric oxygen 2.4 ATA x 60 minutes 3 times per week. I did DEXA body scans every 2 to 3 days for tracking and also consumed roughly 1.5 g of BCAAs upon waking and roughly 3 g of BCAAs intraworkout. After a 10day fast, I had lost zero muscle mass. In contrast, I lost nearly 12 pounds of muscle in that first 7day fast. How and why the difference? First, I allowed trace amounts of BCAAs and 300 to 500 calories of pure fat per day on my fast. Second, I got into ketosis as quickly as possible to skip muscle wasting. I can now do this in under 24 hours instead of 3 to'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

I did DEXA body scans every 2 to 3 days for tracking and also consumed roughly 1.5 g of BCAAs upon waking and roughly 3 g of BCAAs intraworkout. After a 10day fast, I had lost zero muscle mass. In contrast, I lost nearly 12 pounds of muscle in that first 7day fast. How and why the difference? First, I allowed trace amounts of BCAAs and 300 to 500 calories of pure fat per day on my fast. Second, I got into ketosis as quickly as possible to skip muscle wasting. I can now do this in under 24 hours instead of 3 to 4 days. The more often you enter keto, the faster the transition takes place. There appears to be a biological muscle memory related to monocarboxylate transporters and other things beyond my pay grade. Fasting is key, which is why the keto protocol used at Johns Hopkins for children with drugresistant seizures begins with fasting. Heres my protocol for my usual monthly 3day fast from Thursday dinner to Sunday dinner On Wednesday and Thursday, plan phone calls for Friday. Determine how you can be productive via cell phone for 4 hours. This will make sense shortly. Have a lowcarb dinner around 6 p.m. on Thursday. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday mornings, sleep as late as possible. The point is to let sleep do some of the work for you. Consume exogenous ketones or MCT oil upon waking and 2 more times throughout the day at 3 to 4hour intervals. I primarily use KetoCaNa and caprylic acid C8, like Brain Octane. The exogenous ketones help fill the gap for the 1 to 3 days that you might suffer carb withdrawal. Once youre in deep ketosis and using body fat, they can be omitted. On Friday and Saturday if needed, drink some caffeine and prepare to WALK. Be out the door no later than 30 minutes after waking. I grab a cold liter of water or Smartwater out of my fridge, add a dash of pure, unsweetened lemon juice to attenuate boredom, add a few pinches of salt to prevent miseryheadachescramping, and head out. I sip this as I walk and make phone calls. Podcasts also work. Once you finish your water, fill it up or buy another. Add a little salt, keep walking, and keep drinking. Its brisk walkingNOT intense exerciseand constant hydration that are key. I have friends whove tried running or highintensity weight training instead, and it does not work for reasons I wont bore you with. I told them, Try brisk walking and tons of water for 3 to 4 hours. I bet youll be at 0.7 mmol the next morning. One of them texted me the next morning Holy shit. 0.7 mmol. Each day of fasting, feel free to consume exogenous ketones or fat e.g., coconut oil in tea or coffee as you like, up to 4 tablespoons. I will often reward myself at the end of each fasting afternoon with an iced coffee with a bit of coconut cream in it. Truth be told, I will sometimes allow myself a SeaSnax packet of nori sheets. Oooh, the decadence. Break your fast on Sunday night. Enjoy it. For a 14day or longer fast, you need to think about refeeding carefully. But for a 3day fast, I dont think what you eat matters much. Ive done steak, Ive done salads, Ive done greasy burritos. Evolutionarily, it makes no sense that a starving hominid would need to find shredded cabbage or some such nonsense to save himself from death. Eat what you find to eat. Once Youre in Keto, How Can You Keep It Going Without Fasting? The short answer is Eat a boatload of fat 1.5 to 2.5 g per kilogram of body weight, nexttono carbs, and moderate protein 1 to 1.5 g per kilogram of body weight each day. Well look at Doms typical meals and day in a minute, but a few critical notes first High protein and low fat doesnt work. Your liver will convert excess amino acids into glucose and shut down ketogenesis. Fat as 70 to 85 of calories is required. This doesnt mean you always have to eat rib eye steaks. A chicken breast by itself will kick you out of ketosis, but a chicken breast cut up into a green leafy salad with a lot of olive oil, feta cheese, and some Bulletproof Coffee for example can keep you in ketosis. One of the challenges of keto is the amount of fat one needs to consume to maintain it. Roughly 70 to 80 of your total calories need to come from fat. Rather than trying to incorporate fat bombs into all meals one does get tired of fatty steak, eggs, and cheese over and over again, Dom will both drink fat between meals e.g., coconut milknot waterin coffee and add in supplemental ice cream, detailed on page 29. Dom noticed that dairy can cause lipid profile issues e.g., can spike LDL and has started to minimize things like cream and cheese. I experienced the same. Its easy to eat a disgusting amount of cheese to stay in keto. Consider coconut milk AroyD Pure Coconut Milk instead. Dom doesnt worry about elevated LDL as long as other blood markers arent out of whack high CRP, low HDL, etc.. From Dom The thing that I focus on most is triglycerides.

Thats a sign that the ketogenic diet is not for you. . . . Its not a onesizefitsall diet. All that preamble out of way, heres what Big Dom eats. Keep in mind that he weighs roughly 100 kg 220 lbs, so scale as needed Breakfast 4 eggs cooked in a combo of butter and coconut oil 1 can of sardines packed in olive oil such as Wild Planet brand can oysters Crown Prince brand. Note Carbs on the label are from nonglycemic phytoplankton Some asparagus or other vegetable TF Both Dom and I travel with boxes of sardines, oysters, and bulk macadamia nuts. Lunch Instead of lunch, Dom will consume a lot of MCT throughout the day via Quest Nutrition MCT Oil Power. He will also make a Thermos of coffee with a half stick of butter and 1 to 2 scoops of MCT powder, which he sips throughout the day, totaling about 3 cups of coffee. Dinner One trick Ive learned is that before dinner, which is my main meal of the day, Ill have a bowl of soup, usually broccoli cream soup or cream of mushroom soup. I use concentrated coconut milk in place of the dairy cream. I thin it out with a bit of water so its not super dense in calories. After eating that, the amount of food that I want to consume is cut in half. Doms dinner is always some kind of large salad, typically made up of Mixed greens and spinach together Extravirgin olive oil Artichokes Avocado MCT oil A little bit of Parmesan or feta cheese A moderate amountabout 50 gof chicken, beef, or fish. He uses the fattiest versions he can get and increases the protein in the salad to 70 to 80 g if he had a workout that day. In addition to the salad, Dom will make some other vegetable like Brussels sprouts, asparagus, collard greens, etc., cooked in butter and coconut oil. He views vegetables as fat delivery systems. Doms Recipe for Keto Ice Cream Doms ice cream recipe contains roughly 100 g of fat, or 900 kcal of keto goodness. It can save the day if your dinner is lacking fat remember to hit 70 to 85 of total calories from fat! 2 cups sour cream I like Straus Creamery brand or unsweetened coconut cream not coconut water 1 tablespoon dark chocolate baking cocoa 12 pinches of sea salt my favorite is flaky Maldon 12 pinches of cinnamon A small dash of stevia Dom buys NOW Foods organic stevia in bulk Optional 1312 cup blueberries, if Dom hasnt had carbs all day, or if he has worked out Stir that all into a thick mousse and stick it in the freezer until it takes on an ice creamlike consistency. Once youve removed it and are ready to dig in, you can eat it straight or add toppings Make whipped cream using heavy cream nearly 100 fat and a bit of stevia. Drizzle on 1 tablespoon of heated coconut oil especially if the bomb has the blueberries in it and mix it all in, which produces the mouthfeel of crunchy chocolate chips. The keto diet calls for around 300 g of fat per day at Doms body weight of 100 kg 220 lbs. This dessert helps up the ante dramatically. Its also delicious. Doms wife does not follow a ketogenic diet, but even she loves this dessert. Doms Tip for Vegetarians MRM Veggie Elite Performance Proteinthe chocolate mocha is very good. If you take roughly one scoop and mix it with coconut milk, throw in a half an avocado, pour in some MCT oilthe C8 oilthe shake that I made up has 70 of the calories from fat and 20 of the calories from protein, 10 of the calories from carbohydrates.

More on Fasting and Cancer Treatment Fasting before chemotherapy is definitely something that should be implemented in our oncology wards, says Dom. He adds, Fasting essentially slows sometimes stops rapidly dividing cells and triggers an energetic crisis that makes cancer cells selectively vulnerable to chemo and radiation. There are good studies to support this. One of my friends is in full remission from advanced testicular cancer. Others in his chemo cohort were laid out for 2 to 3 days in bed after chemo sessions, but he fasted for 3 days before sessions and was running 10 miles the next morning. Fasting sensitizes cancer cells to chemo, as mentioned, but it also helps normal cells resist the toxicity. This isnt appropriate for all patients, especially those with extreme cachexia muscle wasting, but it is applicable to many. In cases of cachexia, some selective androgen receptor modulators SARMs, which are designed to have the anabolic tissuebuilding potency of testosterone and other anabolic steroids without the androgenic i.e., secondary hormonal effects, could be helpful. Dom is also researching the use of BCAAs. He has had 50 increase in survival in cancerous rats by adding the branchedchain amino acids to a ketogenic diet. Just as promising, the animals maintained their body weight. In one study, treating mice with aggressive metastatic brain cancer using keto and hyperbaric oxygen treatment HBOT, Dom, Dr. Seyfried, and other scientists were able to increase the average survival time from 31.2 days standard diet to 55.5 days. For the HBOT protocol, Dom used 2.5 Atmospheres 2.5 ATA for 60 minutes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Including pressurization and depressurization, each session lasted about 90 minutes. Even in a worstcase scenarioif a patient is intubated and on their last legsone could potentially add exogenous ketones to an IV alongside or in place of glucose, as exogenous ketones have been demonstrated to have a significant tumorsuppressing or shrinking effect, even in the presence of dietary carbohydrates. To me, the last italicized part is the most remarkable. If you think the ketogenic diet is for lunatics, exogenous ketones only require mixing a scoop in water and swigging it down. 5 THINGS in Case of LateStage Emergency Here are the 5 things Dom would do if he were diagnosed with one of the worstcase scenarioslatestage glioblastoma GBM, an aggressive brain cancer. Some of Doms colleagues are opposed to the standard of care protocols, like chemotherapy. Based on the literature, Dom feels these are warranted in situations involving testicular cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and stage 1 and 2 breast cancer. Outside of those examples, it makes little sense to treat cancer with something we know is a powerful carcinogen chemotherapy. Doms 5 picks all appear to work through overlapping mechanisms. This means that there is a synergy in using them together. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. 1 1 1 1 1 10, lets say, not 5. Ive starred those on the following list that Ive experimented with myself. Ketogenic diet as base therapy. This is the foundation. Intermittent fasting 1 meal per day within a daily 4hour window Ketone supplementation 2 to 4 times per day His objective would be to elevate his BHB levels 1 to 2 mmol above his baseline, achieved by the aforementioned two. In other words, if he were running at 1.5 mmol using a 1mealperday modified Atkins diet, he would take enough supplemental ketones to consistently achieve 2.5 to 3.5 mmol. The easiest options are KetoCaNa andor Quest Nutrition MCT Oil Powder. Combining them, youre approaching the potency of a ketone ester developed for military applications. The powdered MCT increases gut tolerability 2 to 3 times versus oil, so you can consume more of it. Metformin He would titrate the daily dosage i.e., start low and gradually increase until he reached GI distress diarrhea or reflux, then dial it back slightly. This would give him his upper tolerable limit, which ranges from 1500 to 3000 mgday for most people. DCA dichloroacetic acid For reasons not completely understood, and under some circumstances, DCA can kill cancer cells at dosages relatively nontoxic to normal cells. Dom would start with 10 mg per kilogram of body weight he weighs 100 kilograms and titrate up, not exceeding 50 mg per kilogram, as you can start to experience peripheral neuropathy at that level thiamine B1 can reduce neuropathy.

Patrick Arnold Patrick Arnold FB prototypenutrition, prototypenutrition.com, widely considered the father of prohormones, is the organic chemist who introduced androstenedione remember Mark McGwire? and other compounds into the dietary supplement world. He also created the designer steroid known as THG, or The Clear. THG and two other anabolic steroids that Patrick manufactured best known norboletone werent banned at the time of their creation. These hardtodetect drugs were at the heart of the BALCO doping scandal involving Barry Bonds and others. These days, Patrick is innovating in the legal world of ketone supplementation, including breakthroughs for military and commercial applications. The New Performance Enhancers No big surprise, Im fascinated by all performanceenhancing drugs, which have been used since before the first Olympiad. On the legal side, here are two of Patricks creations that Ive found useful Ur Spray Ursolic Acid Ursolic acid helps with body recomposition. The benefits are summarized nicely in the title of one study Ursolic Acid Increases Skeletal Muscle and Brown Fat and Decreases DietInduced Obesity, Glucose Intolerance and Fatty Liver Disease. It cant be ingested in pill form, as it will be destroyed by firstpass liver metabolism nor can be it be injected, as it doesnt mix with oil. This led Patrick to create a topical alcohol suspension, as ursolic acid is neither hydrophilic nor hydrophobic. Tricky stuff. Ur Spray is sold on his Prototype Nutrition site. Funny side note The dose is 50 sprays for approximately 249 mg of active ursolic acid. Thats a lot of pumping. Some other guests wives have complained about latenight bathroom Pssshhh! Pssshhhh! Pssshhh! sessions that seem to go on forever. Patrick Arnolds PreWorkout Shake If you are in ketosis, drinking exogenous ketones pre and intraworkout can substitute for carbs. As Patrick elaborates Its pretty amazing. Ive given it to people who tell me, Im on the ketogenic diet, and I work out and I feel like crap. I say, Try this, and they say, Wow! I didnt get tired.

My body had all the fuel it needed. My friend Ian Danneys company, Optimum EFX, has a product called Amino Matrix. Its very expensive but since Ive worked with himwe make some of his productsI get it for free. Its basically a full spectrum of essential amino acids, branchedchain amino acids with some other things thrown in there lipoic acid, citrulline malate, and a few other things. I mix that with about 45 ml of KetoForce, which is the liquid exogenous ketones youre not supposed to drink straight see the jet fuel story on page 60. If you mix it with the Amino Matrix, which is very tart, it buffers the alkalinity of the KetoForce and it ends up tasting quite good. TF A tablespoon of lemon juice in the water you use to dilute KetoForce will also work for buffering. If KetoForce is too odd for your stomach, try the powdered KetoCaNa, also developed by Patrick, which I often use before aerobic exercise. Metformin for Life Extension Both Patrick Arnold and his frequent collaborator, Dominic DAgostino, PhD page 21, are interested in metformin, which is not their creation. Dom considers it the most promising of the antiaging drugs from a scientific standpoint, and I would estimate that a dozen of the people in this book use it. In type 2 diabetics to whom its prescribed, metformin decreases the livers ability to make and deposit glucose into the bloodstream. Metformin also dampens the signaling pathways associated with cancer growth proliferation. Rats with metastatic cancer in Doms studies have increased survival rates by 40 to 50. It mimics calorie restriction and fasting in many respects. Some researchers believe it could damage mitochondria, but nonetheless, many MDs and technologists are taking metformin prophylactically to prevent cancer. Dom did a test where he took 1 g of metformin daily for 12 weeks, and had blood work done throughout. His diet and exercise didnt change. In his post test, his triglycerides were the lowest they had ever been, his HDL was around 98 bumping up from 80, and his Creactive protein wasnt even measurable. The only side effect he saw was that his testosterone was lower, and that came back into normal range once he stopped taking metformin.

A 1ton metal Ibeam had been stuck in the water for a few years, and the state was going to fine him some obscene amount if he didnt remove it. It would have cost him tens of thousands of dollars to have it removed, so instead, he had his winter Death Racers get in the river in January and remove it for him. It took us probably 8 hours. I came away with seconddegree frostbite in most of my toes, as did many others. And the hilarious part? People paid HIM to experience that the race entrance fee AND he avoided fines and the cost of removal. Fucking genius.

Wim The Iceman Hof Wim Hof TWIG IcemanHof, icemanwimhof.com is a Dutch world record holder nicknamed The Iceman. He is the creator of the Wim Hof Method and holds more than 20 world records. Wim is an outlier of daredevils, as he routinely asks scientists to measure and validate his feats. Here are just a few examples In 2007, he climbed past the death zone altitude on Mount Everest 7,500 meters wearing nothing but shorts and shoes. In 2009, Wim completed a full marathon above the Arctic Circle in Finland, once again only in shorts, despite temperatures close to 20C 4F. Wim has set multiple records for ice bath endurance, with his best time at nearly 2 hours. In 2011, he ran a full marathon in the Namib Desert without water. He can also run at altitude without suffering altitude sickness. WARNING NEVER DO BREATHING EXERCISES IN WATER OR BEFORE TRAINING IN WATER. SHALLOWWATER BLACKOUTS CAN BE FATAL, AND YOU WILL NOT FEEL THE ONSET UNTIL ITS TOO LATE. Wim Hof breathing should never be done near water. Joshua Waitzkin page 577, another podcast guest with decades of freediving experience, suffered a shallowwater blackout at a public pool in New York City and was underwater for an additional 3 minutes before being pulled out by a lifeguard. He remained unconscious for an additional 20 minutes, and was then hospitalized for 3 days and subjected to a barrage of tests to assess the damage, including potential brain damage. He could have died extremely easily. So, to reiterate Do not practice this type of breath work in combination with water immersion. There will be no warning sign before you lose consciousness. Mkay? A MindBlowing Experiment Before I describe the exercise, I shall repeat my usual refrain Dont be stupid and hurt yourself, please. Use a very soft surface in case you face plant. Do a set of pushups and end a few repetitions short of failure. Record the number. Rest at least 30 minutes. Do 40 repetitions of the following breathing exercise Max inhale raise chest and let go exhale drop chest sharply. The letgo exhale can be thought of as a short hah. If youre doing this correctly, after 20 to 30 reps you might feel loose, mild lightheadedness, and a little bit of tingling. The tingling is often felt in the hands first. On the last breathing cycle, breathe in completely, exhale completely, then do another set of pushups. More often than not, people will experience a sharp increase in the max number of pushups, even though their lungs are empty. Cold Is a Great Purifying Force Wim, surfing king Laird Hamilton page 92, and Tony Robbins page 210 all use cold exposure as a tool. It can improve immune function, increase fat loss partially by increasing levels of the hormone adiponectin, and dramatically elevate mood. In fact, Van Gogh was prescribed cold baths twice daily in a psychiatric ward after severing his own ear. All the problems I have in the daily world subside when I do cold exposure. Exposing myself to the worthy cold . . . it is a great cleaning purifying force.

The letgo exhale can be thought of as a short hah. If youre doing this correctly, after 20 to 30 reps you might feel loose, mild lightheadedness, and a little bit of tingling. The tingling is often felt in the hands first. On the last breathing cycle, breathe in completely, exhale completely, then do another set of pushups. More often than not, people will experience a sharp increase in the max number of pushups, even though their lungs are empty. Cold Is a Great Purifying Force Wim, surfing king Laird Hamilton page 92, and Tony Robbins page 210 all use cold exposure as a tool. It can improve immune function, increase fat loss partially by increasing levels of the hormone adiponectin, and dramatically elevate mood. In fact, Van Gogh was prescribed cold baths twice daily in a psychiatric ward after severing his own ear. All the problems I have in the daily world subside when I do cold exposure. Exposing myself to the worthy cold . . . it is a great cleaning purifying force. Wim takes cold to terrifying extremes his retinas froze once while swimming in a lake under sheets of ice, but you can start with a cold water finish to showers. Simply make the last 30 to 60 seconds of your shower pure cold. Among others in this book, Naval Ravikant page 546, Joshua Waitzkin page 577, and I now do this. Josh does it with his tiny son, Jack, who hes trained to say Its so good! when it feels unbearable. Below is my current cold regimen, often alternated with heat, which we covered on page 7. My full workout process then, is 1 preworkout BCAA, 2 workout, 3 postexercise whey protein, 4 immediate heat 20 minutes followed by 5 cold 5 to 10 minutes. I repeat the hotcold cycle 2 to 4 times. My postworkout cold routine is as follows Put 40 pounds of ice this will depend on your bathtub size into a bathtub, and then fill with water. That order avoids splashing and speeds things up. Instacart is helpful for ice delivery, or buy a garage freezer just for bags of ice, which is far easier than fancy icemaking or cooling contraptions. 15 to 20 minutes later, when the water reaches 45F, it is ready for use. I drop a 5 immersion thermometer from Carolina Biological Supply Company in the water for tracking. Coach Sommer page 9 uses the low 50sF for his athletes. After heat, I enter the ice bath, keeping my hands out of the water. This allows me to stay in for longer, as capillary density is high in the hands. Hands go under for the last 3 to 5 minutes. The Magic Diet I expected a mutant such as Wim to have dietary tricks. When I asked him about his typical dinners, his answer made me laugh I like pasta, and I like a couple of beers, too. Yeah! How can he function on this food? Genetics might play a role, but he also rarely eats before 6 p.m. and tends to eat one single meal per day. To use the lingo of the cool kids He has practiced intermittent fasting for decades now. HearttoHeart Hugs When I first trained with Wim in person in Malibu, California, I noticed he hugged differently than most people. He throws his left arm over the persons shoulder, putting his head to the right of theirs. I asked someone on his team if he was lefthanded. No. He just wants to hug hearttoheart with everyone. I love this, and several friends in this book now do this on special occasions. Just be forewarned It throws people off, just like offering someone your left hand to shake, so best to explain just tap your heart and say heart to heart. This also helps to avoid headbutts. Wim Dom Interesting During that same training session, I went from my normal 45second breath hold time to 4 minutes and 45 seconds with no perceptible side effects. Several months later, while in deep ketosis 6 mmol after 8 days of fasting, I did the same exercises in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber at 2.4 ATA. The result? I held my breath for a staggering 7 minutes and 30 seconds before stopping in fear of my brain melting. In case you miraculously missed my warning at the beginning of this profile page 42, read it. If you read it, please reread it. For more on ketosis and fasting, see Dominic DAgostino on page 21. Rick Rubins Barrel Sauna Here are the specs for Rick Rubins page 502 barrel sauna, which is a slightly smaller version of what Laird Hamilton page 92 has. There are two long benches along the walls, and it can easily seat 6 to 8 people. It is about 7 feet in diameter and height. I have an exact duplicate in my backyard, which I often use 1 to 2 times daily, as it only takes 5 to 15 minutes to warm up. How on earth is it so fast? The heater is 3 to 4 times larger than it should be for the cubic footage. This is done on purpose, but it will freak out suppliers who are hesitant to combine a small sauna with a large heater.

Jason was a twotime U.S. Junior National champion in sports acrobatics and represented the U.S. at the World Championships in Beijing in 1991. He performed acrobatics in the opening ceremonies of the 1996 Olympics. AcroYoga now has certified teachers in more than 60 countries and hundreds of thousands of practitioners. Back Story In 2015, I sat next to Jason at a dinner party at a friends house in L.A. Somehow, my lowerback painwhich had been plaguing mecame up, and he offered to fly me on the spot. Having no idea what that was, I agreed and ended up getting spun around in the air on his feet for about 15 minutes. It was surreal and seemed to defy the laws of physics. Two things worth noting I weighed 180 pounds and he weighs 160 hes done the same with someone 280 and 67, and my back no longer hurt after the upsidedown traction. In the past, Id always been repelled by yoga too much mumbojumbo, too little excitement. AcroYoga is a different beast. Youll endure the occasional Sanskrit, but its otherwise like a combination of bodyweight strength training, dance the base is the lead, and the flier follows, roughhousing lots of wipeouts, and hip rehab after ten sessions, my lower body felt 10 years younger. Its also the ultimate movementbased Prozac. In a culture where physical touch is taboo, this allows you to experience sensual but not sexual connection, all while getting incredibly strong and flexible. Last but not least, I laugh at least 50 of the time in all training sessions. Its a wonderful balance to all the serious training that I do. If youd like to see me both basing and flying, as well as teaching some basic techniques, just search acroyoga on youtube.comtimferriss. Odds and Ends Duck Shit Oolong Tea Jason brought this delicious tea for us to drink during recording. Its sometimes called duck shit fragrance tea. Supposedly, long ago in a region in China, the local populace wanted to keep this amazing tea for themselves, so they nicknamed it duck shit tea. Smart move. It was played down for centuries, until being rediscovered as very much nonduck shit flavored. Jason gets his from Quantitea quantitea.com. Jason has traveled the world for the last 6 years, never staying in one place more than 3 weeks. He travels with next to no luggage but insists on carrying a ukulele and a donkeys load worth of tea. FeetUp Shoulder Stand Device or Substitutes The limiting factor for most people learning handstands is the wrists. This weakest link prevents you from getting enough upsidedown practice. The FeetUp device addresses thisimagine a small padded toilet seat cushion mounted on a low stool. You stick your head through it, rest your shoulders on the padding, grab the two handles, and kick up into a headstand or handstand, with your shoulders supporting your weight. This allows you to work on alignment, tightness, positional drills tuck, pike, straddle, etc. in higher volume. The FeetUp is Jasons preference, but its hard to find in the U.S. en.feetup.eu. The BodyLift Yoga Headstand and Yogacise Bench are similar, or search for yoga headstand bench. A Saying from One of Jasons Mentors, Chinese Master Acrobat Lu Yi Mo extension! more extension. In a handstand, you should push your shoulders as near or past your ears as possible. If youve ever done shrugs with dumbbells, imagine doing that with your arms overhead, and avoid arching your back. Also, the first knuckle fist knuckle of the index finger is prone to lifting off the ground in handstand practice. Jason calls this the naughty knuckle.

My mom was not happy when I was going to go to the Middle East for the first time. I was actually in Boston, about to lead a teacher training, when the Boston Marathon bombing happened. I had 15 students who were on lockdown for 24 hours. I got on the phone to my mom and I said Look, Mom, you think Israel is dangerous. Im in Boston. You cannot hide from danger. But I dont think thats a reason to not trust people. Ive traveled the world in some very sketchy places and Ive never had anything bad happen to me. I assume the best in people. I assume that I can trust them until they prove me wrong. When you do this practice enough, trusting is like a muscle that you flex. It doesnt mean that Im a cowboy with it. I have really good credit assessment. TIM Hold onyou said nothing bad has happened to you. How much of that is simply seeing things in the most positive light? Because you had your throwing knives stolen by customs officers in Panama. So shit happens, Im imagining. Jason laughed, was quiet for a second, then answered One of the things that happened to me that was really amazingI had all of my objects liberated from me. . . . Basically, I didnt want to work in restaurants anymore, and Im like, Im a yogi. Im going to do this. I dont care how hard it is. I love this. Boom. So I was living in my van. My 30th birthday, my friend throws me a party. That night I got a book on Buddhism, a case of coconuts, and I hung out with my friends. The next day, my vans gone. My home is gone. Everything is gone. So I go crack a coconut and start reading about Buddhism because . . . what the fuck else am I gonna do? And page 4 is talking about homelessness and wandering. I think, Thats what Im going to do. And that started my nomadic traveling. If I had stayed in San Francisco and tried to make it as a yoga teacher, AcroYoga wouldnt be a worldwide practice. Let go of whats not working and really assess what is working and what can I be excited about? Its not that bad things dont happen to me. I dont label a lot of things goodbad. Instead, I ask can I evolve from this? What do I want now? Where is my center now? Mostgifted or recommended books The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran I love really condensed, shakti empowermentfilled, energyfilled statementssomething that you can read in a few minutes or you can read for your whole life. TF This little tome is fewer than 100 pages long. Spend the extra 5 for the version with the authors illustrations. Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu Jason travels with this book. Oftentimes before meditation, Ill just open it randomly to a page. I read about something and then just have that be what I steep in as I sit. See Rick Rubin, page 502, and Joshua Waitzkin, page 577. When I asked Jason via text which translation he liked, he joked Tao de Chinga tu madre ah, my friends, and then specified Stephen Mitchell. Jasons best 100 or less purchase Jason loves disc Frisbee golf and travels with discs. In particular, Innovas Roc midrange disc and his goto driver, the TeeBird. He plays the game, but he also, on rare occasions, lets a disc go I correct people when they get really serious because there are people who have caddies. For real. Those people think its a sport. Its a pastime, no matter how hard you work at it. Its a piece of plastic, and youre throwing it around. . . . But to watch a disc fly for about a minute, its magical. . . . In yoga, theres this philosophy, svaha. I call it Fuck it, let go. . . . I like to throw Frisbees off of really high objects. And when Im in these very ceremonial places like Machu Picchu, its like, What am I releasing? So its an intentional act. What would you put on a billboard? Play! Play more.

Parting Thoughts Dont Overcompartmentalize On theoretical yoga versus applied yoga I also feel that theres a ceiling on yoga, and the ceiling is You have all this amazing knowledge and all this amazing practice, but how are you bringing that into the world? What happens when youre in traffic? How are you with your mom? Do you talk to your mom? Do you tell her the truth? AcroYogaThai and Fly AcroYoga is a blend of three complementary disciplines yoga, acrobatics, and therapeutics. The therapeutics were brought into the fold by Jenny SauerKlein, the other cofounder of AcroYoga along with Jason Nemer, page 46, and resemble suspended Thai massage. So much so that its often referred to as Thai and fly. Ive seen Jason blow highlevel acrobats minds even those from Cirque du Soleil with Folded Leaf page 55, perhaps the easiest of all AcroYoga therapeutic poses. Be forewarned that its sometimes jokingly referred to as Leaf Blower, as it puts face close to groin. If your partners not ready to be inches from your crotch, Hippie Twist page 54 is a Disneyfriendly alternative. To intro you to the Acro world, Ill share a few of my favorite moves from therapeutic flying. They are much safer than acrobatics, which require a teacher and spotters. In 5 minutes or so, Ive used the following to fix lowerback pain in at least six of the people featured in this book. I havent felt this type of release and relaxation in years . . . or ever is a common response. Take it SLOW and enjoy! If its uncomfortable, youre not doing it right. Do this on a mat or grass, and I suggest practicing the moves in the order listed. Anything in quotation marks is what Id say as a base the person on their back teaching a firsttime flyer the person getting inverted. Good rule for Acro and for life Tell people what you want, not what you dont want, and keep it simple. In other words, say Stronger elbows and not Dont bend your arms. Say Softer feet and not Stop poking my abs with your toes. There are a million ways to teach Acro basics well, of course. The following is my personal preference. Before Inverting Anyone FLYER Practice on the ground what youll be doing in the air. Sit on the ground, legs straight and spread 90 degrees is fine, back as straight as possible. This is a pike straddle position. The angle between your torso and thighs should be 90 degrees. This bend at the hips is super critical, as it provides a shelf foothold for the bases feet. Put your hands on top of your hip crease, including the first 1 to 2 inches below. Ill say That is where my feet are going to be. Now, bring your feet in, soles together, into butterfly stretch position. The space in between your legs should look something like a diamond. For you yoga people who love Sanskrit, its baddhakonasana. The asana suffix just means pose. This all meant nothing to me when I first started learning, so I called it butterkanasa for months. Keeping that butterfly position, now reach behind your back and grab your elbows. If you cant do that, grab your forearms. BASE Load test your legs. Get on your back and put your legs straight up in the air. This is an Lbase position. Have your flyer cross their arms so that their forearms are on their chest. Have them place their forearms across both of your feet and lean onto you, putting weight on your legs. How does it feel? Dont let your toes drift toward your face, which will make things strenuous. Keep the hip angle at 90 degrees, if possible. If your hamstrings are very tight, you can fold a yoga mat or towel and put it under your lower back. The elevation will help. Hippie Twist BASE Lie down. FLYER Stand right by the bases hips, feet twice shoulder width apart. BASE Put your slightly turnedout feet on flyers hip creases. BASE Tell flyer, Put your hands on my knees. fig. A Look in my eyes, take a deep breath. As you exhale, bend forward and Ill catch your shoulders. Keep your hands on my knees but let your arms bend. And, if needed, Aim to put the top of your head on my stomach. BASE Meet flyers shoulders with arms straight and fingers pointing up, and lift flyer into the air. fig. B Keep your legs wide and your feet heavy. Toes to the ground. FLYER Keep a strong bend at your hips. Most flyers lift their legs, losing the shelf, which can lead to a fall. Another cue Keep your feet as close to the floor as possible. Let your upper body be heavy and legs be'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

There are dozens upon dozens of techniques e.g., Bus Driver, but this one gives a fantastic bang for the buck. Since Ive never heard a name for it, Ill call it Gravity Boots, as the effect is similar. Even used independent of AcroYoga, this exercise has therapeutic value. BASE Lie on your back, legs straight and spread a few feet. FLYER Stand between bases legs and pick up their feet, holding onto the lower Achilles and top of the heel.

Deconstructing Sports and Skills with Questions As Tony Robbins would say, The quality of your questions determines the quality of your life. When I was interviewing athletes and coaches from 2008 to 2010, digging up nonobvious tactics for The 4Hour Body, I sent different combinations of the following questions to dozens of experts. These can be modified for any skill or topic, not just sports. Just replace SPORT with what you want to learn, and track down your mentors. You can often find past gold and silver medalists willing to answer these via Skype for 50 to 100 per hour, which is an incredible steal and could save you years of wasted effort. Who is good at SPORT despite being poorly built for it? Whos good at this who shouldnt be? Who are the most controversial or unorthodox athletes or trainers in SPORT? Why? What do you think of them? Who are the most impressive lesserknown teachers? What makes you different? Who trained you or influenced you? Have you trained others to do this? Have they replicated your results? What are the biggest mistakes and myths you see in SPORT training? What are the biggest wastes of time? What are your favorite instructional books or resources on the subject? If people had to teach themselves, what would you suggest they use? If you were to train me for 12 weeks for a FILL IN THE BLANK competition and had a million dollars on the line, what would the training look like? What if I trained for 8 weeks? In the case of basketball, I added four more to the above. The following questions were emailed to Rick Torbett, the founder of Better Basketball What are the biggest mistakes novices make when shooting or practicing shooting? What are the biggest misuses of time? What mistakes are most common, even at the pro level? What are your key principles for better, more consistent shooting? What are they for foul shots free throws vs. 3pointers? What does the progression of exercises look like?

Peter rarely eats breakfast and has experimented with many forms of intermittent fasting, ranging from one meal a day i.e., 23 hours of fasting per day to more typical 168 and 186 patterns of eating i.e., 16 or 18 hours of fasting and only eating in an 8 or 6hour window. Going 16 hours without eating generally provides the right balance of autophagy look it up and anabolism muscle building. Random Bits Peter spent 3 straight years in nutritional ketosis, and maintained a high level of performance not only in ultralong distance cycling and swimming, but also in strength e.g., flipping a 450pound tire 6 times in 16 seconds. He still enters ketosis at least once per week as a result of fasting one primary meal per day at 6 to 8 p.m., and he feels he is at his best on a ketogenic diet. His main reason for moving away from it was a craving for more fruits and vegetables. Peter is obsessed with many things, including watches like the Omega Speedmaster Professional, Caliber 321, which has been around since the 1950s and professionalgrade car racing simulators. The simulator Peter owns uses iRacing software, but the hardware seated cockpit, steering wheel, hydraulics, etc. is all custombuilt, so it doesnt have a name. His favorite car to drive is the Formula Renault 2000. Why Peter and I Get Along Peter explains the joy of drinking his first experimental batch of synthetic exogenous ketones The first one I tried was the betahydroxybutyrate ester, which a very good friend of mine sent me Dominic DAgostino, page 21, and I had been told these things taste horrible. I had talked to two people who had consumed them before, and these are stoic, military dudes. These werent 6yearold kids. They said, Oh, man, thats the worsttasting stuff on earth. So I knew that, but I think that piece of information was fleeting in the excitement when the box came. I tore open the box, and there was also a note in there that explained a somewhat palatable cocktail that you could mixhow you could mix this with ten other things. I just disregarded that and took out the 50ml flask. I chugged it, and I remember it was like 600 in the morning, because my wife was still sleeping. First of all, you drink it, and it tasted like how I imagine jet fuel or diesel would taste. If youve ever smelled distillate, its this horrible odor, and you can sort of imagine what it would taste like. This is what it tasted like, and so my first thought was, Goddamn, what if I go blind? What if theres methanol in here? What did I just do? And then my next thought was just, Oh my god, youre gagging. I mean, youre really gagging. If you puke this stuff up, youre gonna have to lick up your puke. Its just gonna be a disaster. And so Im retching and gagging and trying not to wake up the family and trying not to spew my ketone esters all over the kitchen. It took around 20 minutes for me to get out and do my bike ride, which was the whole purpose of that experiment. Tools of the Trade Peter wears a Dexcom G5 continuous glucose monitor to track his glucose levels 247, which are displayed on his iPhone. His real goal, if he could wave a magic wand, is to keep his average glucose and glucose variability low.

Tools of the Trade Peter wears a Dexcom G5 continuous glucose monitor to track his glucose levels 247, which are displayed on his iPhone. His real goal, if he could wave a magic wand, is to keep his average glucose and glucose variability low. Outside of a lab, this approximates minimizing your insulin area under the curve AUC. To accomplish this, Peter aims to keep his average glucose per 24hour period at 84 to 88 mgdl and his standard deviation below 15. The Dexcom displays all of this. Peter calibrates the Dexcom 2 to 3 times per day with a OneTouch Ultra 2 glucometer, which requires less blood and appears more accurate than the Precision Xtra that I use for ketone measurement. Glute Medius Workout Modern man is weakest and most unstable in the lateral plane. Having a very strong gluteus medius, tensor fasciae latae, and vastus medialis is essential for complete kneehip alignment and longevity of performance. Peter once visited me in San Francisco and we went to the gym together. In between sets of deadlifts and various chalkladen macho moves, I glanced over and saw Peter in a centerfold pose doing what looked like a Jane Fonda workout. Once I finished laughing, he explained that he avoided knee surgery thanks to this exercise set, taught to him by speed guru Ryan Flaherty and kinesiologist Brian Dorfman Brian also helped him avoid shoulder surgery after a torn labrum. I tried his reverse thighmaster series and was dumbstruck by how weak my glute medius was. It was excruciating, and I felt and looked like an idiot. See Coach Sommers quote, If you want to be a stud . . . on page 10. For each of the following 7 moves, start with 10 to 15 reps each. Once you can do 20 reps for all 7 consecutively, consider adding weight to your ankles. Youll likely feel quite smug and selfsatisfied for the first few, but remember No rest until all 7 are done and no rest in between exercises. For all of thesekeep your big toe below your heel think pigeontoed to ensure youre targeting the right muscles, and perform this series 2 times per week. 1UpDown Lie down on your side and use your arm to support your head. Keeping your legs straight, lift your top leg and lower it, keeping your foot internally rotated as described above. Dont lift the foot very high. The max angle at your crotch should not exceed 30 degrees. Higher reduces the tension and defeats the purpose. For exercises 24, maintain a roughly 12inch distance between your ankles at the bottom. Maximize tension on the glute medius and only move your leg in a horizontal plane. Ensure the ankle doesnt dip when kicking behind you, for instance. In the first 1 or 2 workouts, aim to find the leg height that is hardest for you. Its usually 12 to 18 inches from the lower ankle. Remember to keep toe below heel. 2Front KickSwing Kick your top leg out to 45 degrees at the hip as shown below. Think cabaret. 3Back Swing Swing your leg back as far as possible without arching your back. 4Full Front and Back Swing Swing your leg forward and then back the previous two combined, with no pause at the midline. 5Clockwise Circles Paint an 18inchdiameter circle with your heel. Remember, at the bottom of the circle, your ankles should be roughly 12 inches apart. If you let the ankles get within inches of each other, youre cheating. 6Counterclockwise Circles Repeat in the other direction. 7Bicycle Motion Pedal as if you were using a bicycle. Easy peasy, Japanesey? Switch sides and repeat. Plank Circles on Swiss Ball The goal of this separate exercise is to create scapular shoulder blade movement and rotation. Scapular mobility is one of the keys to upperbody function and longevity. The target muscles are the teres minor, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, subscapularis, and rhomboid. The setup is simple Get into a plank position with your elbows propped on a Swiss ball, forearms pointing straight ahead. Dont sag between the shoulder blades or at the lower back keep the hollow and protracted positions described on page 19. Start with the legs wide for stability, and you can narrow the feet as you get stronger. Keeping your body in this position, use your forearms to move the ball as described below. One set consists of 10 to 15 reps of each of the following with no rest in between Clockwise circles Counterclockwise circles Forward and backward i.e., sliding the elbows forward 6 to 12 inches and then back to your ribs When youre doing this correctly, you should feel your entire shoulder blades scapulae moving. Peter will do 3 total sets per workout, 2 times per week. He will superset these with Wolverines Google it on a cable machine. If done correctly, Wolverines target the rhomboids more than the deltoids. 5 Blood Tests Peter GENERALLY Recommends Of course, the answers depend on the individual and the risks each person faces cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc. based on family history and'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

If done correctly, Wolverines target the rhomboids more than the deltoids. 5 Blood Tests Peter GENERALLY Recommends Of course, the answers depend on the individual and the risks each person faces cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc. based on family history and genetics, butbroadly speakinglooking through the lens of preventing death, these five tests are very important. APOE Genotype This informs my thinking on a persons risk for Alzheimers disease AD. The gene is far from causal, meaning, having it does not cause AD, but it increases risk anywhere from a bit to a lot, depending on which variant you have and how many copies you have. For what its worth, the apoE phenotype i.e., the actual amount of the lipoprotein in circulation in your body is more predictive of AD than the gene and is obviously a better marker to track, however a test is not yet commercially available. Stand by, though. Im working on it. LDL Particle Number via NMR technology that can count the number of lipoproteins in the blood This counts all of the LDL particles, which are the dominant particles that traffic cholesterol in the body, both to and from the heart and to and from the liver. We know that the higher the number of these particles, the greater your risk of cardiovascular disease. Lpa LPlittleA via NMR The Lpa particle is perhaps the most atherogenic particle in the body, and while its included in the total of LDL particle numbers, I want to know if somebody has an elevated Lpa particle number, because that, in and of itself, independent of the total LDL particle number, is an enormous predictor of risk. Its something we have to act on, but we do so indirectly. In other words, diet and drugs dont seem to have any effect on that number, so we pull the lever harder on other things. Nearly 10 of people have inherited an elevated level of Lpa, and it is hands down the most common risk for hereditary atherosclerosis. The bad news is that most doctors dont screen for it the good news is that knowing you have it can save your life, and a drug in a class called apoa antisense drugs to treat it directly will be around in approximately 3 or 4 years. OGTT Oral Glucose Tolerance Test In this test, you drink a glucose concoction and then look at insulin and glucose response at 60 minutes and 120 minutes. The 1hour mark is where you may see the early warning signs with elevated glucose levels or anything over 40 to 50 on insulin, which can represent hyperinsulinemia, a harbinger of metabolic problems. In fact, the 1hour insulin response may be the most important metabolic indicator of your propensity to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, even in the presence of normal traditional markers such as HbA1C. IGF1 Insulinlike Growth Factor1 This is a pretty strong driver of cancer. Diet choices e.g., ketogenic diet, caloric restriction, intermittent fasting can help keep IGF1 levels low, if such a strategy is warranted. Ketosis Warning Signs Keto works well for many people, but its not ideal for all. Its also not clear why some people do well for long periods of time, while others seem to derive max benefit from cycling. If certain markers get elevated e.g., Creactive protein, uric acid, homocysteine, and LDL particle numbers, its likely that the diet is not working properly for that person and requires tweaking or removal. Some patients who suffer from significant LDL particle number increases on keto can reverse the trend by limiting saturated fat to fewer than 25 g and replacing the required fat calories with monounsaturated fats e.g., macadamia nut oil, olive oil, limited avocado oil. Before You Get Comprehensive Work Done, Decide What Your Threshold of Action Is The likelihood of doing comprehensive testing and finding everything normal is low, so dont have testing done unless youre willing to accept the uncertainty that comes from needing to make decisions or not with incompleteand at times conflictinginformation. Before you check your APOE gene, for example, you should know what youll do if you have one or two copies of the 4 allele. TF Decide beforehandand not reactively when emotions run highwhat types of findings are worth acting upon or ignoring, and what your ifthen actions will be. The Dangers of Blood Test Snapshots Its important to get blood tests often enough to trend, and to repeatconfirm scary results before taking dramatic action. This has been echoed by other guests who have appeared on my podcast like Justin Mager, MD page 72, and Charles Poliquin page 74 In 2005, I swam from Catalina Island to L.A., and I had my friend Mark Lewis, whos an anesthesiologist, draw my blood around 10 minutes before I got in the water on Catalina Island and then 10 minutes after I got out of the water in L.A., 10.5 hours later. It was a real epiphany for me, because I had developed something called systemic inflammatory response syndrome, SIRS, which is'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

TF Decide beforehandand not reactively when emotions run highwhat types of findings are worth acting upon or ignoring, and what your ifthen actions will be. The Dangers of Blood Test Snapshots Its important to get blood tests often enough to trend, and to repeatconfirm scary results before taking dramatic action. This has been echoed by other guests who have appeared on my podcast like Justin Mager, MD page 72, and Charles Poliquin page 74 In 2005, I swam from Catalina Island to L.A., and I had my friend Mark Lewis, whos an anesthesiologist, draw my blood around 10 minutes before I got in the water on Catalina Island and then 10 minutes after I got out of the water in L.A., 10.5 hours later. It was a real epiphany for me, because I had developed something called systemic inflammatory response syndrome, SIRS, which is something that we typically see in hospitalized patients who have horrible infections or who have been in really bad trauma gunshot, car accident, that sort of thing. My platelets went from a normal level to 6 times normal. My white blood cell count went from normal toI dont know5 times normal. All of these huge changes occurred in my blood, so that you couldnt distinguish me from someone who had just been shot. . . . Ive always been hesitant to treat a patient for any snapshot, no matter how bad it looks. For example, I saw a guy recently whose morning cortisol level was something like 5 times the normal level. So, you might think, wow, this guys got an adrenal tumor, right? But a little followup question and I realized that at 3 a.m. that morning, a few hours before this blood draw, the water heater blew up in his house. The normal level of morning cortisol assumes a guy sleeps through the night. He had to deflood his house. 4 Bullets to Dodge If youre over 40 and dont smoke, theres about a 70 to 80 chance youll die from one of four diseases heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, or neurodegenerative disease. There are really two pieces to longevity. The first is delaying death as long as possible by delaying the onset of chronic disease the big four above. We call that the defensive play. The second is enhancing life, the offensive play. On that defensive play, there are basically four diseases that are going to kill you. In other words, if youre 40 years old and you care about this, youre probably not going to die in a car accident or homicide, because youre out of that demographic. Youre less likely to die of X, Y, and Z. It turns out that when you look at the mortality tables, theres an 80 chance youre going to die from cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, or neurodegenerative disease, period. If you remember nothing else, remember this If youre in your 40s or beyond and you care about living longer, which immediately puts you in a selection bias category, theres an 80 chance youre going to die of one of those four diseases. So any strategy toward increasing longevity has to be geared toward reducing the risk of those diseases as much as is humanly possible. For those who dont know, cerebrovascular disease would be stroke, and theres two ways you can have a stroke. One is through an occlusion the other one is through bleeding, usually due to elevated blood pressure and things like that. Neurodegenerative disease, as its name suggests, is degeneration in the brain. The most common cause of that is Alzheimers dementia, and Alzheimers is one of the top ten causes of death in the United States. Studies suggest to me that theres something about highly refined carbohydrates and sugarsand potentially protein, though it might be for a different reasonthat seems to raise insulin, which we know, by extension, raises insulinlike growth factor IGF. And we know that IGF is driving not just aging but also certainly driving a lot of cancers, though not all of them. Supplements That Peter Does Not Take Peter consumes a fair selection of supplements based on his own blood work, so its highly personalized. He does not take, however, a number of the common ones Multivitamin Theyre the worst of both worlds. They contain a bunch of what you dont really need and dont contain enough of what you do need. It poses an unnecessary risk with no up side. Vitamins A and E Hes not convinced he needs more than what he absorbs through whole foods. Vitamin K If you eat leafy green vegetables, youre getting enough. K2 might be a different story for some people, depending on their diet. Vitamin C Most of us get sufficient amounts in our diet, and while megadoses might be interesting, especially for combatting viral illnesses, its not bioavailable enough in oral form. He is a proponent of magnesium supplementation. Our ability to buffer magnesium with healthy kidneys is very high. He takes 600 to 800 mg per day, alternating between mag sulfate and mag oxide. He also takes calcium carbonate 2 times per week. Two of his favored brands are Jarrow Formulas and NOW Foods. The Logic of LowDose Lithium Based on conversations with Peter, I now take lowdose lithium in the form of 5 mg of lithium orotate. The more I read epidemiological studies, the more Ive come to think of lithium as an essential, or conditionally essential, element. 1 to 5 mg is enough to effectively ensure you are getting the high range of what is naturally occurring in groundwater in the U.S. As a primer, I suggest reading'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

The more I read epidemiological studies, the more Ive come to think of lithium as an essential, or conditionally essential, element. 1 to 5 mg is enough to effectively ensure you are getting the high range of what is naturally occurring in groundwater in the U.S. As a primer, I suggest reading the New York Times piece, Should We All Take a Bit of Lithium? From that article Although it seems strange that the microscopic amounts of lithium found in groundwater could have any substantial medical impact, the more scientists look for such effects, the more they seem to discover. Evidence is slowly accumulating that relatively tiny doses of lithium can have beneficial effects. They appear to decrease suicide rates significantly and may even promote brain health and improve mood. And from Peter Lithium is actually really, really safe at low dosesbasically anything below about 150 mgif you have normal kidney function. Its one of those drugs that got such a bad rap with the large doses that were sometimes needed to treat recalcitrant monotherapy bipolar disorder, but those doseseasily approaching 1200 mghave nothing in common with the logic above. More ComedyLong Ago, When Peter Went from 170 to 210 Pounds, Gaining Mostly Fat Frankly, I just got aggravated beyond words. We joke about it now, but at the time I literally said to my wife, Im going to go get a gastric bypass. And she said, You are the most ridiculous human being whos ever lived. Were going to have to talk about our marriage, if thats what youre considering at the weight of 210 pounds. I actually did go and see the top bariatrician in the city of San Diego, and its kind of weird story because, even though I was obviously overweight, I was the thinnest person in the waiting room by a long shot. It put it in perspective. I thought to myself, Peter, you think youve got problems. I mean, these people each weigh 400 pounds. And when it was my turn to see the doctor, the nurse took me up to the scale and weighed me. We got on the scale, and Im like 210. She says, Ah, this is fantastic. Are you here for a followup? On Dropping Running and Picking up Weights Nothing breaks my heart more than seeing that person whos struggling to lose weight who thinks that they need to run 20 miles a week. They have no desire to do it, their knees hurt, they hate it, and theyre not losing weight. And Id like to say, Well, Ive got great news for you. You dont ever need to run another step a day in your life, because theres no value in that. There is value in exercise, though, and I think that the most important type of exercise, especially in terms of bang for your buck, is going to be really highintensity, heavy strength training. Strength training aids everything from glucose disposal and metabolic health to mitochondrial density and orthopedic stability. That last one might not mean much when youre a 30something young buck, but when youre in your 70s, thats the difference between a broken hip and a walk in the park. Peters Path to Meditation 10 Happier by Dan Harris is the book that got Peter meditating regularly.

The New York Times Sept. 13, 2014. Justin Mager Dr. Justin Mager has helped me with dozens of my human guinea pig experiments, complete with blood testing and nextgeneration tracking. Hes brilliant and hilarious. Justin appeared on the podcast with Kelly Starrett page 122, a mutual friend and collaborator. When we ended the episode, I asked my usual Where should people check you out? Justins answer was, My honest parting comment is not to check me out, just fucking look in the mirror and check yourself out. My aspiration is to go underground and be a ghost. Love this guy. Were Not an Object, Were a Process We want to judge things as good or bad. . . . So, theres this idea that inflammation is bad, thus the opposite is good. High cholesterol bad, low cholesterol good. But you have to understand what blood testing actually represents. First of all, its a snapshot. Its a moment in time, and were not an object, were a process. Optimal Depends on What Youre Optimizing For For instance, theres some literature that suggests that if you have high LDL cholesterol, you can actually build more lean body mass at a faster rate. So, if youre in a strengthbuilding phase, it actually might be to your advantage to actually have that present . . . you need to know context. You also have to understand what the marker actually represents, not just have a judgment of whether its good or bad. Hey, Doc, What Does Cholesterol Do? I like to ask that to physicians, especially if theyre antagonizing me about my practice methods. I say, Hey, what does cholesterol do? and its interesting, because a lot of them will take a step back and theyll fumble, because theyre so indoctrinated into the algorithm of All I really need to do is identify high cholesterol and treat it versus understanding what purpose it serves in the human body. TF There is a big difference between understanding something what you want in a physician and simply knowing its name or labeling it. This is also one of the lessons that Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynmans father taught him. The story is contained in Surely Youre Joking, Mr. Feynman!, the mostgifted book of several people in this book, as well as in a wonderful short documentary called The Pleasure of Finding Things Out.

He has written 8 books, including a short gem entitled Arm Size and Strength The Ultimate Guide. Just Because You Exercise Doesnt Mean You Deserve Sugar Water The most important thing Ive learned about nutrition is you need to deserve your carbs . . . to deserve hundreds of kcal of carbs postexercise, you need to be sub10 body fat. And the quickest way to know if you have sub10 body fat as a male is Can I see the lineal alba vertical separation on your abs? In other words, can I see all ab rows? One ab row doesnt count youve got to see them all. In other words, you have to have penis skin on your abs. TF One female reader responded on social media with What if its someone elses penis skin? Might be a workaround. Ive got some athletes who do best on 70 carbs, 20 protein, 10 fat. But they deserve their carbohydrates. Theyve got a great pancreas, theyre insulinsensitive, blah, blah, blah, theyve got a lot of muscle mass. But some athletes, theyre allowed 10 licks of a dried prune every 6 months. Thats all they deserve and thats all theyll get. And after 6 months, theyre actually allowed to look at calendar pictures of cakes once a week. TF For a lowcarb postworkout option, see goat whey on page 84 Portable Fuel. How Do You Identify a Good Strength Coach? A good strength coach should get a female, no matter what her body fat is, to be able to do 12 chinups in 12 weeks. Charless Typical Breakfast Charles takes breakfast seriously. His typical combo includes some type of wild meat typically pan fried in Meyenberg goat butter, nuts, and sometimes berries or avocados I really like macadamia nuts, but I vary that so I dont develop intolerances. . . . On the road, one of the reasons I stay at the Marriott worldwide is its the only place that will serve steak and eggs. When traveling, of course, things can be harder In Manchester UK, for example, there was no way I could get steak and eggs for breakfast, so my assistant and I bought sardines. So we had sardines and Brazil nuts for breakfast the next day. I dont negotiate on that. For me, I either have meat, fish, or seafood and some nuts. TF I bolded the above, as I have many friends whove been tested for food intolerances and called me with Im intolerant to navy beans! Egg whites, too! Such results dont necessarily mean you have genetics that disallow these foods. Theres a decent likelihood that A youve simply been consuming too much of the same food and provoked a correctable autoimmune response, or B the lab has made an error. Ive seen labs return every patient dozens in a given week as intolerant to egg whites. Lab errors happen, equipment malfunctions, and people make mistakes. The moral of the story Vary your food sources and confirm any scary test results with a second test. For Loose Skin or Stretch Marks Theres an herb called gotu kola thatI learned this from Dr. Mauro Di Pasquale, who was one of my early mentorswill get rid of what we call unnecessary scar tissue or unnecessary connective tissue. The truth of the matter, though, is that you will see zero progress for the loose skin for 6 months. So people say its not worth it, but I tell people, just keep doing it for 6 months. And then its almost like overnight. . . . There are some compounding pharmacists who will make you a gotu kola bioabsorbable cream. That works a lot faster. I would say if you can find a compounding pharmacist who will do that, and its a biologically active form, you could get the same results in about 2 to 3 months. TF I asked Charles about oral sources, and he suggested one dropperful of Gaia Herbs Gotu Kola Leaf liquid extract per day, which also improves tendon repair and cognitive function. 4 Tests to Check Every 8 Weeks Charles recommends checking these biomarkers every 8 weeks Morning fasting insulin Morning fasting glucose One thing I insist on is that they always do this test exactly 12 hours after the last bite. Why? Because I want pre and postmeasures that are valid. Your morning glucose could be all over the place because you fasted an extra 2 hours, and its not valid. TF This is a hugely important point. Standardize as many variables as possible. For instance, I will do blood tests on the same day of the week, and attempt to hydrate equally, typically by drinking 12 liters of water and ensuring my pee is clear. Imagine that you do one blood test on Thursday, then your followup tests on a Monday after a weekend of booze, which can elevate liver enzymes. The values arent comparable. Its also a good idea to avoid hard workouts for the 24 hours prior to your blood tests, if possible, so you dont get a false read on inflammatory markers. Control thy variables!

Ive found over the years that, actually, the amount of magnesium, supplemental magnesium, you consume, is the fastest way to drop that value. So magnesium is probably one of the best antiaging minerals. More on Magnesium I think the best magnesium out there is magnesium threonate, if I were to pick one. But I prefer taking different chelates. TF Dominic DAgostino also takes magnesium see page 30 for his thoughts. So I use glycinate, I use orotate. If you look at the physiology behind it, and theres a lot of good research thats really easy to find, every form of magnesium tends to go to a specific tissue. So for example, magnesium glycinate has a preference for liver and muscle tissue magnesium orotate tends to work more in the vascular system. Magnesium threonate is more of a GABA inducer, therefore it improves sleep. Personally, I take 2g of magnesium threonate at the last meal before going to bed, and I use various forms of chelates like magnesium glycerophosphate from GabaMag made by Trilogy Nutritional Supplements. Another goto recipe for sleep glutamine and physicianprescribed probiotics vary the brands before bed. On Good Doctors The length of time they spend with you on your first visit is probably your best indicator of their quality. To Increase T, Decrease C As a rule . . . the best thing to increase testosterone is to lower cortisol. Because the same raw material that makes testosterone and cortisol is called pregnenolone. Under conditions of stress, your body is wired to eventually go toward the cortisol pathway. TF If youve ever laid down in bed exhausted, then felt wired and been unable to sleep, cortisol might be a factor. To mitigate this tired and wired phenomenonas well as reduce glucose levelsbefore bed, I take phosphatidylserine and Nacetyl cysteine NAC. For me, this also has a noticeable impact on lowering anxiety the following day. The best educator on HRT Hormone Replacement Therapy is Thierry Hertoghe from Belgium. Back squat, front squat, or overhead squat, if you had to choose one for your athletes? The front squat. I have a lot of statistical data on that. Because it is impossible to cheat on the front squat. Im talking asstothegrass front squat, meaning you leave a stain in the carpet in the bottom position. In my opinion, for athletic purposes, all squats should be done that way. . . . They should perform it the way the Olympic lifters do it. So hands slightly wider than shoulder width, elbows up as high as you can, and actually the elbows in. That locks the bar into right in front of your throat. If you find the exercise comfortable, youre not doing it correctly. You should feel some restriction in the neck when you front squat properly. See Kelly Starretts thoughts on squats on page 124. Step 1 in a Squat Warmup Theres a lot of research that shows that mobility in the ankle is what decreases the probability of any lower extremity injuries, whether its an ACL tear or hamstring pull or groin tear or whatever. So the first thing I would do in a warmup prior to squatting is go on a calf machine and stretch the calves, and then go down and statically stretch for 8 seconds. Id finish off with voluntary contraction, because it resets the pattern for strength. Research is clear If you do static stretching and you dont finish with a contraction, youre more likely to get an injury. TF This, along with Paul Levesques recommendation, prompted me to take Cossack squats seriously see page 87. I pay more attention to my calves now than ever before, both for injury prevention and upperleg flexibility see Christopher Sommer, page 9. Activating the Hamstrings I once took a Kinetic Chain Enhancement seminar under Charles, in which he tore my arms apart with ART Active Release Techniques and doubled my shoulder internalrotation ROM in minutes see The 4Hour Body. He also taught us the muscletendon techniquehow to activate the hamstrings, among other muscles, by using simple crossfiber friction near the insertion points. For instance, to immediately increase your strength output in a set of hamstring curls, you could lie on the floor and have someone use a knife handthink judo chop edgeto rapidly rub back and forth on each of the dotted lines in this illustration for 8 to 10 seconds each. For reasons that exceed the space we have, start at the gluteal fold butt fold lines for hamstring curls, but start with lines just below the knee for deadlifts.

It has this halfmoon shape it attaches to any bench where your spine rests. So when you do pressing movements, you can drop the elbows much farther than with a regular bench. It allows for a freer scapular movement, it allows for a greater range of motion when you lift, and it allows painfree upper body pressing. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? Winston Churchill. This guy had balls. He stood up to Hitler, he rallied the United Kingdom, he refused to surrender. Hes a Nobel Prize winner in literature. Very few people know that.

The SlowCarb Diet Cheat Sheet Many people lose hope when trying to lose weight. Fortunately, it need not be complicated. Though I regularly fast and enter ketosis, the SlowCarb Diet SCD has been my default diet for more than a decade. It works almost beyond belief and affects much more than appearance. From one reader I just wanted to sincerely thank Tim for taking the time to research and write The 4Hour Body. My mom, in her late 60s, lost 45 pounds and got off her high blood pressure meds that she had been on for 20 years. She did all this in about 3 months. This means that I get to have her around for a long time. The basic rules are simple, all followed 6 days per week Rule 1 Avoid white starchy carbohydrates or those that can be white. This means all bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and grains yes, including quinoa. If you have to ask, dont eat it. Rule 2 Eat the same few meals over and over again, especially for breakfast and lunch. Good news You already do this. Youre just picking new default meals. If you want to keep it simple, split your plate into thirds protein, veggies, and beanslegumes. Rule 3 Dont drink calories. Exception 1 to 2 glasses of dry red wine per night is allowed, although this can cause some peripostmenopausal women to plateau. Rule 4 Dont eat fruit. Fructose glycerol phosphate more body fat, more or less. Avocado and tomatoes are allowed. Rule 5 Whenever possible, measure your progress in body fat percentage, NOT total pounds. The scale can deceive and derail you. For instance, its common to gain muscle while simultaneously losing fat on the SCD. Thats exactly what you want, but the scale number wont move, and you will get frustrated. In place of the scale, I use DEXA scans, a BodyMetrix home ultrasound device, or calipers with a gym professional I recommend the JacksonPollock 7point method. And then Rule 6 Take one day off per week and go nuts. I choose and recommend Saturday. This is cheat day, which a lot of readers also call Faturday. For biochemical and psychological reasons, its important not to hold back. Some readers keep a toeat list during the week, which reminds them that theyre only giving up vices for 6 days at a time. Comprehensive stepbystep details, including QAs and troubleshooting, can be found in The 4Hour Body, but the preceding outline is often enough to lose 20 pounds in a month, and drop 2 clothing sizes. Dozens of readers have lost 100200 pounds on the SCD. My 6Piece Gym in a Bag I take these 6 items with me whenever I travel. In some cases, I buy several sets, which live in trunks stored at hotels in my most common locations, like L.A. and NYC. For the cost of checking luggage on a few flights, I can have my kit waiting in a few cities and avoid checkin lines. Voodoo Floss 20 to 30 This looks like a rubber ACE bandage. It is used to wrap and compress stiff or injured body parts. Its small enough to fit in a jacket pocket, yet it often decreases pain and increases ROM more than fancy injections and 200hour therapy. I use Voodoo Floss 1 to 2 times per day on my elbows and forearms during hard gymnastics training. Source Kelly Starrett page 122.

Halos Grasp a weight with both hands and rotate it around your head to loosen up the shoulder girdle. I use a 25 to 45pound kettlebell or plate for this and perform 5 slow reps in each direction. Start light. Cossack Squat When everything else failed, Cossack squats with a kettlebell as shown below roughly doubled my ankle mobility, which had a chain of positive effects. Keep your heels on the ground throughout, keep your knees in line with your toes, and keep your hips as low as possible when switching sides.

Strength is a skill, and, as such, it must be practiced. Lift heavy, not hard. Anything more than 5 reps is bodybuilding. . . . If you want to be strong, you want to keep your reps at 5 and under.

Then Ross read Pavels prescription for increasing strength with minimal muscle gain deadlifts with heavy weights, low reps, low volume, and a deemphasized negative. Barry put two and two together and developed a deadliftbased program to create worldclass sprinters. One of his early prodigies was Allyson Felix. His deadliftbased protocol utilizes partial range of motion and no negativeeccentric lowering. I followed this protocol over a period of 8 weeks and describe this at length in The 4Hour Body, so Ill only provide the simplified basics here The Basic Technique Deadlift to your knees and then drop the bar. I used a sumostyle stance, but conventional is fine. Format 2 to 3 sets of 2 to 3 reps each, each set followed by plyometrics e.g., sprinting 10 to 20 meters, 6 to 8 box jumps, etc., then at least 5 minutes of rest. My best gains came from 10minute rests, which arent uncommon among power athletes. Frequency I did this twice weekly, on Mondays and Fridays. The total time under tension during sets is less than 5 minutes per week. Results I added more than 120 pounds to my max deadlift in 8 weeks and gained less than 10 pounds of additional mass. For relative strength, Ive never experienced anything like it. Think youre too old, or too X for deadlifts? Pavels father took up this lift in his 70s. He pulled more than 400 pounds without a belt a few years later, setting several American records in the process. The Breathing Ladder Have terrible endurance? Heres a strategy from Pavels colleague, fitness instructor Rob Lawrence. For kettlebell swings, sprints, or any exercise that makes you feel gassed, decide beforehand that youre going to rest from one set to the next for a certain number of breaths i.e., you get to do 5, 10, 30, or however many in between. This is going to discipline you to slow your breathing and stop overtaxing your nervous system. This control will help your endurance, even before biochemical adaptations. Amelia Boone page 2 uses the breathing ladder with burpees as a warmup. She will do ascending sets of burpees, from 1 rep to 10. In other words, shell do 1 burpee, take 1 breath, 2 burpees, 2 breaths, and so on until she does 10 burpees and 10 breaths. 3 HighYield ExercisesPavels Simple Sinister Kettlebell Program Onearm swing Turkish getup TGU Goblet squat Do these three exercises in some form every day, and you are guaranteed to get a great return on your investment. The TGU is also excellent for diagnosing deficiencies. The Hollow Position Isnt Just for Gymnastics If you want to master pullups, you need to develop your hollow position see page 19. This, plus turning my toes inward engaging obliques more fully, helped me to do strict military pullups neck to the bar with pause with 24 kg on the feet. To see the hollow position in action, watch any gymnast on rings The tail is tucked in and the body looks like a dish. Pavels tip Try to bring your tailbone and your navel closer to each other. When in Doubt, Train Your Grip and Your Core Strengthening your midsection and your grip will automatically increase your strength in any lift. With the abs, the effect is partly due to greater intraabdominal pressure and partly to improved stability. With the grip, you are taking advantage of the neurological phenomenon of irradiationtension radiates from the gripping muscles into other muscles. The most direct route to elite grip strength is IronMinds Captains of Crush Grippers which are available up to 365pound resistance. Among effective midsection exercises are power breathing, hollow rocks, Janda situps, hanging leg raises, and hardstyle planks. To do the last, hold a plank for 10 seconds under max contraction, not for several minutes. Hold it like youre about to be kicked and breathe behind the shield of your tensed midsection. For a challenge, consider putting your feet on the wall, a few inches from the floor. For reps and sets, do 3 to 5 sets of 3 to 5 reps in dynamic moving exercises or hold 10 seconds for static exercises. Take 3 to 5 minutes of rest in between sets for both. Or, as Pavel would say, Better yet, grease the groove. That leads us to the next principle. Grease the Groove for Strength Endurance and Strength To increase your pullup numbers, start doing half the reps youre capable of e.g., sets of 4 if your personal best is 8 in repeated sets throughout the day. Simply accumulate reps with at least 15 minutes between sets, and adjust the daily volume to always feel fresh. Using GTG for several months, Pavels fatherinlaw went from 10 to 20 strict pullups at age 64and he could not do that many when he was a young Marine. The minimum of 15 minutes rest is necessary for creatine phosphate hypercompensation. Whereas most strengthendurance programs work by training one to tolerate more lactic acid, GTG instead trains one to produce less'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

Brian has created controversy by suggesting a counterintuitively minimalist approach to distance running. He challenges not only highmileage runs, but also highcarb diets, and he utilizes intense strength training to conquer everything from 5K runs to ultramarathons. He was prominently featured in The 4Hour Body, where he described how to prepare for a marathon in 8 to 12 weeks. Brian has been featured in Runners World, Mens Journal, ESPN, Outside, and The Economist. Back Story Laird was one of my surfing teachers in my TV series, The Tim Ferriss Experiment, which was shot by ZPZ, the production company behind Anthony Bourdains No Reservations, Parts Unknown, etc. My interview with Laird, Gabby, and Brian took place at Laird and Gabbys kitchen table in Malibu, immediately after a workout. I felt as high as a kite. Brian had brought me to experience how Laird trains in his customized pool, which is 13 feet deep at the deep end and has stairs built into the floor.

It also features underwater speakers for music and a slack line about 2 feet above the surface. Id been invited by Brian before but always demurred out of fear of drowning. That morning, I bit the bullet and nervously joined 6 to 10 other guys to repeat the following cycle for roughly 90 minutes underwater training with dumbbells, ice bath for at least 3 minutes, then 220F sauna for 15 minutes. The entire gang does this workout twice a week, alternating with twiceweekly dry land weighttraining sessions. They cheer each other on, and its wonderful. Assholes dont last long. The Warmup for Tough Guys Top professional athletes occasionally visit Laird to testdrive his famed pool workout. If a big musclehead comes in with an attitude, hell suggest they go warm up with Gabby. This is code. Gabby proceeds to casually annihilate them, leaving them bugeyed, full of terror, and exhausted. Once theyve been forcefed enough humble pie, Laird will ask Okay, are you ready to start the workout? As Brian has put it The water goes, Oh, mighty and aggressive? Perfect. Ill just drown you. What We Drank Preworkout Laird made everyone coffee, which he mixed with his own mochaflavored superfood creamer lairdsuperfood.com. It lights you up like a Christmas tree. Postworkout Freshsqueezed turmeric root, chaga mushroom, liquid pepper extract, raw honey, apple cider vinegar, and water dilute to taste. Laird sometimes combines the turmeric with KeVita kombucha to reduce any residual bitterness. Gear in the Pool Cressi Big Eyes 2lens diving mask. Goggles will come off. Psoas ReleaseNot Supposed to Feel Good Laird routinely releases his psoasdeep muscles that connect the lower back and the hipby getting on the ground and lying on top of either a kettlebell handle or the edge of a 25pound Olympic weightlifting plate. The Man Book Club Laird has what Gabby calls the man book club. The regulars who come to his house to trainwhich includes super celebs, worldrecordsetting free divers, and hugely successful CEOscan suggest a nonfiction book of the month and everyone will read it for discussion. Rick Rubin is a frequent contributor. Here are two that made the cut just prior to our interview Natural Born Heroes by Christopher McDougall Deep Survival by Laurence Gonzales, which Laird calls an incredible book about fear and dealing with fear. Practice Going First GABBY I always say that Ill go first. . . . That means if Im checking out at the store, Ill say hello first. If Im coming across somebody and make eye contact, Ill smile first. I wish people would experiment with that in their life a little bit Be first, becausenot all times, but most timesit comes in your favor. The response is pretty amazing. . . . I was at the park the other day with the kids. Oh, my God. Hurricane Harbor water park. Its like hell. There were these two women a little bit older than me. We couldnt be more different, right? And I walked by them, and I just looked at them and smiled. The smile came to their face so instantly. Theyre ready, but you have to go first, because now were being trained in this world to opt outnobodys going first anymore. TF People are nicer than they look, but you have to go first. This made me think of a line from fictional character Raylan Givens in the TV series Justified If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, youre the asshole. I will often write GO FIRST in my morning journal as a daily prompt. Side note Derek Sivers page 184 listened to this episode and Gabbys go first principle was one of his favorite takeaways. Early Kiteboarding Experiments, Before It Was Popular We were the first ones to get the French nonrestartable kites . . . where you release the guy and he just flies until he craps and then its over. Sometimes youd be like 2 miles out to sea with a giant quilt. Have you ever tried to swim with a quilt? Its very hard. Like a giant quilt . . . and a lunch tray. Literally, the board looks like a lunch tray and youre 2 miles out, and youre looking at the shore and youre like This is not a good day for me. Where Can Listeners Find You? I ask this at the end of all of my interviews, so guests can mention social media, websites, etc. Laird answered without hesitation The Pacific Ocean. The Inspiration of Don Wildman BRIAN, discussing Don Wildman and his incredible physical prowess at the age of 82 Well, Don Wildman did 80 days of snowboarding last year. I just went heli snowboarding with him 1 or 2 months ago in Alaska. I mean, heli boarding is a rigorous activity, a week straight of 15, 16 runs a day.

I can take pretty much almost anybody on a bicycle unless youre like a professional bicyclist, and he will hammer you. GABBY The other thing Don does thats very genius . . . is he solicits people to be in his group because no man can really do it alone. So he always has these guys around him, most of them quite a bit younger. So the energy goes into the pot, and everybody rolls. TF Rick Rubin also talks about Don on page 506. A Lonely Place Is an Unmotivated Place This line from Laird underscored everything I saw around him. He has a tightly bonded tribe around him, and scheduled group exercise appears to be the glue that keeps the group together. If you spend a lot of time thinking of the how and what of exercise exercises, programming, etc., as I do, you might consider asking yourself, What if I had to choose all of my exercise based on Who? first? What would I do if exercise were only allowed with other people? This is how I ended up diving into AcroYoga page 52. Parenting Advice Laird and Gabby, married since 1997, have very close and affectionate relationships with their three kids. Ive observed them over and over again. There is a lot of physical touch, and the pervasive feeling is one of warmth. Its lovely to be around. The following parenting tidbits are taken from different points in the conversation. LAIRD Loving your children can override a lot of wrongs. Even if you get some of the specifics wrong or make missteps. GABBY Were inclusive, and we treat them like adults. Weve always spoken to them like adults. . . . As a parent, you have to learn to say sorry because you blew it. . . . Sometimes you can go, Hey, you know what? I am extra tired today and my fuse is short. I am being unfair to you, and Im sorry. You have to learn that youre imperfect and open that door. . . . I always ask my girls, Do you feel loved enough? . . . and they say, Oh, come on, Mom. But I think you should ask. . . . I tell my kids to learn how to say, Im sorry, that doesnt work for me. Ive learned a lot from being around men. I respect a lot of traits. You can deliver a message without emotion. Usually, women, in order to finally stand up for themselves, they have to kind of be ramped up, and then it just comes out ballistic, instead of, No, that doesnt work for me. And I also teach them not to then second guess themselves after theyve laid that line down. I think that thats really important. And if you have gifts and talents, whatever they are, dont feel guilty and bad or weird about it. . . . I always tell kids, If youre on the team, youre lucky, and if youre the best one, youre the luckiest. Gabby on Learning Assertion As a woman, were taught as young girls, Hey, be nice. Nice girls act like this, so it takes a long time to get to a place of Im going to do things, say things, and believe in things that people arent going to like, and Im going to be okay with that. Men do that much more easily, and it takes women a very long time. The only female athletes Ive seen that do it very easily are generally the youngest girl in a family with all older brothers. See Caroline Paul, page 459. On the MaleFemale Dynamic in Relationships LAIRD Of 10,000 successful couples studied, theres only one thing that everybody had in common, no matter what the dynamic. What is it? The man respected the woman. The number one thing. GABBY But can I say one thing? I know all those dynamics differthe womans the breadwinner, the mans the breadwinner, shes dominant, hes dominant, whateverbut ultimately, more times than not, if the woman can refrain from trying to change or mother her partner, she has a greater opportunity of putting herself in a position where the guy will respect her. A man needs support. I mean, I love you guys and youre all strong, but youre very fragile, and you need to be supported and for us to help you fully realize your voice, whatever that is. Laird said to me the first couple of years we were togetherunfortunately, his mom passed away the second year we were togetherI had a mom, and she died. He made it very clear . . . thats off the table. Women by nature, we cant help it, were nurturers, right?

TF By more humility, I took Brian to mean considering scary options with an open beginners mind. Im so thrilled I took the risk of embarrassment to train with Laird and the gang. First, it showed me an intense but sustainable method of training, which includes ingredients I often neglect social cohesion, training outdoors, etc.. Second, it made me believe I am capable of much more than I thought. Advice for Your 30YearOld Self? GABBY Not to take anything personally, but also dont hold yourself back. I think this is a trait of a female more than of a male. We have a tendency sometimes to sit on our talents and potential because we dont want to offend anyone or be singled out. . . . I heard a great story. I had a coach once, who was an assistant coach to the mens USA volleyball team. One game they needed one point, and the coach looked straight at Karch Kiraly and said, I need you to put this ball away and for you to win this game, and it was like, boomOkay. And then Karch did it. Then the same coach was coaching women at a very high level, and he did the same thing to the athlete who was the one. It didnt work because . . . its a singlingout that we women have a hard time with, instead of understanding that you can be singled out . . . for the greater good. LAIRD Stop drinking now.

I watched one family friend go from normal to schizophrenic his family had a history of it after frequent LSD use. Of course, I wouldnt want you to go to jail or hurt yourself, so only use psychedelics in legal contexts with professional medical supervision. For a legal alternative, see Dan Engles discussion of flotation tanks on page 110. What Are Psychedelics? The word psychedelic Greek for mindrevealing is generally used to refer to compounds that can reliably separate you from your ego and occasion mystical or transcendental experiences. The best formal definition of psychedelics Ive found is that of N. Crowley in The British Journal of Psychiatry A role for psychedelics in psychiatry? The difference between psychedelics entheogens and other psychotropic drugs is that entheogens work as nonspecific amplifiers of the psyche, inducing an altered or nonordinary state of consciousness Grof, 2000. The content and nature of the experiences are not thought to be artificial products of their pharmacological interaction with the brain toxic psychoses but authentic expressions of the psyche revealing its functioning on levels not ordinarily available for observation and study. Many psychedelics psilocybin, mescaline, etc. have been used ceremonially for hundreds or thousands of years by indigenous cultures. More recently, universities around the world have begun testing these molecules for addressing treatmentresistant depression, removing endoflife anxiety in terminal cancer patients, ending nicotine addiction, and more. Roland Griffiths, PhD, a professor at Johns Hopkins medical school, shares a typical upshot from one early study Most of the 36 volunteers looked back on their experience up to 14 months later and rated it as the most, or one of the five most, personally meaningful and spiritually significant of their lives. For volunteers with children, the experience was often put above, or on par with, the birth of their first child. From a psychopharmacological perspective, many psychedelics resemble a naturally occurring molecule called DMT and act as 5HT2A serotonin or NDMA receptor agonists, but there are exceptions, and the mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. This is part of the reason that Im helping fund scientific studies at places like Johns Hopkins and UCSF. Although marijuana, ketamine, and MDMA have compelling medical applications, I dont consider them psychedelics. Jim explains our shared distinction, using MDMA as an example Its not exactly a psychedelic because you dont leave your identity behind, but it is the single best way to overcome intractable posttraumatic stress disorder. The noun entheogen, meaning generating the divine within, has become a popular alternative to the term psychedelic. My Good Friend I have a good friend, lets call him Slim Berriss, whos devised a schedule for himself that combines practical microdosing and preplanned 1 to 2day treks into deeper territory. For him, this blend provides a structured approach for increasing everyday wellbeing, developing empathy, and intensively exploring the other. Here is what it looks like Microdosing of ibogaine hydrochloride twice weekly, on Mondays and Fridays. The dosage is 4 mg, or roughly 1200 or less of the full ceremonial dosage at Slims bodyweight of 80 kg. He dislikes LSD and finds psilocybin in mushrooms hard to dose accurately. Woe unto he who microdoses and gets hit like a freight train while checking in luggage at an airport poor Slim. The encapsulated ibogaine was gifted to him to solve this problem. Moderate dosing of psilocybin 2.2 to 3.5 g, as ground mushrooms in chocolate, once every 6 to 8 weeks. His highly individual experience falls somewhere in the 150 to 200 mcg description of LSD by Jim later in this piece. Slim is supervised by an experienced sitter. Higherdose ayahuasca once every 3 to 6 months for 2 consecutive nights. The effects could be compared though very different experiences to 500 mcg of LSD. Slim is supervised by 1 to 2 experienced sitters in a closeknit group of 4 to 6 people maximum. NOTE In the 4 weeks prior to these sessions, he does not consume any ibogaine or psilocybin. Note that not all psychedelics are for all people. Jim, for instance, doesnt use ayahuasca. On our walk in a canyon in San Francisco, he said to me, I feel like the plant aya has its own agenda. Id have to agree with him, but that could fill an entirely separate book. Be sure to read Dan Engle and Martin Polancos profiles on page 109, which explore ayahuasca and ibogaine, specifically.

If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. If you are at peace, you are living in the present. Lao Tzu Most of us have had the experience of sitting at a computer with 20 open tabs. How did this happen? Didnt I just clean this up last week? Then you get a warning of Startup disk almost full. So you delete a few videos as damage control, but . . . why is everything still running so damned slowly? Oh, Dropbox is syncing. Slack has 17 new notifications. Microsoft needs another critical update? There are 20 applications running on top of 20 windows, fracturing your ability to focus. 60 minutes later, youve done a lot of stuff, tapped the keyboard a lot, and burned a ton of energy, but you couldnt say what youve achieved. Feeling rushed and frustrated, overwhelm begins to set in. Time to go get another coffee . . . Life can feel this way. Finances, taxes, relationships, wedding invitations, car checkups, Facebook, groceries . . . Startup disk almost full. For me, moderate to high dose of psilocybin with supervision serves as a hard reboot. It closes all the windows, force quits all the applications, flushes the cache, installs upgrades, andwhen Im back to normalrestores my 30,000foot view. It removes the noise, giving me a crystal clear view of the most critical priorities and decisions. The first time I used psilocybin at sufficiently high doses, the anxiolyticanxiety decreasingeffect lasted 3 to 6 months. This catalyzes not only insight but action. Sounds great, right? It can be, but that result is far from guaranteed. Psychedelics usually give you what you need, not what you want. To get to pleasure, you often need to claw through pain first. Doses and EffectsFrom Niagara Falls to a Casual Stroll NOTE The below dosages are specified by Jim. They are listed from high to low and are specific to LSD, but the effects correlate to many psychedelics. Heres framing context from Jim These substances, unlike almost every other kind of medication, have very different effects at different dose levels. It is almost as if they were different substances. Heroic dose Ethnobotanist Terence McKenna coined the term heroic dose, which is often equated to 5 or more grams of mushrooms or more than 400 mcg of LSD. James doesnt recommend this bruteforce dosing, which McKenna described as sufficient to flatten the most resistant ego. Jim feels that you dont remember anything, nor do you bring anything back, at this dose. Its kind of like You want to go swimming? How about going over Niagara Falls? 400 mcg is where you have a transcendental or mystical experience. At this dose or higher, it is critical to have qualified supervision in the form of a guide. Transcendental here roughly means the feeling or the awareness that you are connected not only to other people but to other things and to living systems. More on this later. 200 mcg can be used for psychotherapy, selfexploration, deep inner work, and healing. 100 mcg is useful for creative problem solving with nonpersonal matters e.g., physics, biomechanics, or architecture. A number of Nobel Prize laureates in chemistry, biology, and elsewhere attribute breakthroughs to LSD. Jim once worked on a study involving large companies and research institutes trying to solve incredibly difficult problems like new circuit board designs. Volunteers were given psychedelics, and 44 out of the 48 problems were solved, meaning resulted in a patent, product, or publication. Jim attributes this to enhanced focus and pattern recognition. Low enough doses i.e., 100 mcg of LSD or 200 mg of mescaline can immensely increase the capacity to solve problems. We said, You may come to this study, and well give you the most creative day of your life. But you have to have a problem which obsesses you that you have been working on for a couple of months and that youve failed to solve. . . . We wanted them to have . . . an emotional money in the game. We gave them psychedelics and had them relax with music and eye shades for a couple of hours. And then, right at the peak, we bring them out and say, You may work on your problem . . . what was wonderful is nobody did any personal therapeutic work because thats not what they came for. And out of the 48 problems that people came in with, 44 had solutions.'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

But you have to have a problem which obsesses you that you have been working on for a couple of months and that youve failed to solve. . . . We wanted them to have . . . an emotional money in the game. We gave them psychedelics and had them relax with music and eye shades for a couple of hours. And then, right at the peak, we bring them out and say, You may work on your problem . . . what was wonderful is nobody did any personal therapeutic work because thats not what they came for. And out of the 48 problems that people came in with, 44 had solutions. 50 mcg is considered a concert dose or museum dose. Selfexplanatory. 10 to 15 mcg is a microdose. Described by Jim Everything is just a little better. You know at the end of a day when you say, Wow, that was a really good day? Thats what most people report on microdosing. Theyre a little bit nicer. He elaborates What Im finding is that microdoses of LSD or mushrooms may be very helpful for depression because they make you feel better enough that you do something about whats wrong with your life. Weve made depression an illness. It may be the bodys way of saying, You better deal with something, because its making you really sad. A microdose of psychedelics is actually a low enough dose that it could be called subperceptual, which means you dont necessarily see any differences in the outside world. As one person said to me, The rocks dont glitter even a little, and the flowers dont turn and watch you. Albert Hofmann, the inventor of LSD, considered microdosing the most neglected area of research. Hofmann microdosed LSD often for the last few decades of his life. He remained sharp until he died at 101. He would take it when he was walking among trees. In Jims opinion, microdosing psychedelics does a far better job than a whole class of drugs we now call cognitive enhancers, most of which are simply derivatives of speed. Oddly, there are consistent reports of microdosing having a lag effect. Ive experienced this myself, and its the reason for Slim Berrisss MondayFriday spacing of ibogaine. Many microdosers, including one executive who runs a large corporation with manufacturing in five countries, have said, The second day is better. Which Users Have the Most Durable Positive Effects? In short, its those who experience a transcendental experience. Remember that squirrelly term? Jim describes this as the feeling or the awareness that you are connected not only to other people, but to other things and living systems and to the air you breathe. We tend to think were kind of encapsulated. . . . Obviously, the air I am breathing comes from all over the world, and some of its a billion years old. Every 8 years, I get almost all new cells from something. Everything I eat is connected to me. Everyone I meet is connected to me. Right now you and I are sitting outside, and our feet our touching the ground. Were connected to the ground. Now, thats all easy to say intellectually and even poetically. But when you actually experience that youre part of this larger system, one of the things that you become aware of is that your egoyour personal identityis not that big a part of you. What I learned wasand this is from my own personal experience in 1961Jim Fadiman is a subset of me, and the me is very, very large and a lot smarter and knows a lot more than Jim Fadiman. He saw a similar shift in subjects during his dissertation research, and they very often laughed during these realizations In a very deep way, and it isnt the giggles of marijuana. Its the laughter of how could I have forgotten who I really am? And then, much later in the day, when theyre reintegrating and finding that they are surprisingly still in the same body they came in with . . . one person said very beautifully, I was back in the prison of all of the things that hold me back, but I could see that the door was locked from the inside. Dont Rush the Experience, Dont Cheapen the Experience Theres something called Salvia divinorum, and the wonderful thing about salvia is it has nothing to do chemically with anything else Ive just talked about. . . . Its been used in Mexico historically for who knows how many thousands of years for divination, for finding out things. And, again, we seem to be able as Americans to take almost anything that is indigenous and screw it up in some way. So people smoke salvia and have a short, intense, sometimes meaningful experience.

On the Importance of Pre and Post Work Theres a saying in the psychedelic world If you get the answer, you should hang up the phone. In other words, when you get the message you need, you shouldnt keep asking i.e., having more experiences, at least until youve done some homework assignments, or used the clarity gained to make meaningful changes. Its easy to use the medicine as a crutch and avoid doing your own work, as the compounds themselves help in the short term as antidepressants. Compulsive users generally neglect critical preparation and postsession integration work. MDMA is a wonderful tool for releasing people from PTSD, for instance, but the success can usually be attributed, in large part, to preparing for the experience with a psychotherapist, having two guides male and female, and spending a lot of time talking and integrating after the experience. Theres no point in going to a motivational seminar if youre not going to take any next steps. Spirit animal Martin Gummy bear Martin Polanco Dan Engle Martin Polanco, MD TW MartinPolanco7, CrossroadsIbogaine.com, is the founder and program director of Crossroads Treatment Center, based in Rosarito, Mexico. Crossroads specializes in helping patients conquer powerful addictions such as heroin or cocaine using the African hallucinogen ibogaine and 5MeODMT, also referred to as the God molecule. Dan Engle, MD TW drdanengle, drdanengle.com, is boardcertified in psychiatry and neurology. He combines functional medicine with integrative psychiatry to enhance regenerative health and peak performance. His prior experience includes traumatic brain injury research and working in the Peruvian jungle with plant medicines such as ayahuasca. In this profile, we discuss several psychedelics, including one legal option flotation therapy. Ibogaine and 5MeODMT are detailed at some length, as theyre both used at Martins clinic. Ibogaine is the only compound Ive seen that can eliminate 90 of the physical withdrawal symptoms of heroin addiction in one fell swoop. Its also one of the few psychedelics that can kill you, so I cover it at the end. What would you put on a billboard? DAN Be curious. Flotation Tank as Psychedelic DAN Im just about as excited about flotation therapy as I am about psychedelics, because not everybody is going to do a psychedelic. Maybe its not in everybodys best interests to do it . . . but everybody can float. When prepped well and done consistently over time, it can still be an extraordinary psychedelic arena. By this, I essentially mean coming back to a deeper connection with ones self. TF Flotation therapy, in simple terms, is floating in a roughly 98.6F hot tub with a lid over it. Its completely dark, there is no sound, and there are 800 to 1,200 pounds of Epsom salt in the water to make you float on the surface, feeling weightless. It can be thought of as a sensorydeprivation tank. If you cant handle at least 60 minutes in a flotation tank, you arent ready to have an unstoppable psychedelic experience. As one guide for the latter put it to me I can start the music, but I cant make it stop. In contrast, if you get twitchy during a float, you can step out. Use this environment as training. Labverified lucid dreaming Google Lucid Dreaming 101 Ferriss is also useful for developing navigational skills for psychedelics, but lying in salt water requires less work. When possible, I now try to float twice per weekMonday and Friday. After 2 weeks, I feel like I normally would after a month of daily meditating, even if Im not meditating. DAN Floating in an isolation tank is the first time that weve been without sensory experience, sensory environmental stimuli, since we were conceived. There is no sound, no sight, no temperature gradient, and no gravity. So all of the brains searching and gating information from the environment is relaxed. Everything that was in the backgroundkind of behind the curtaincan now be exposed. When done consistently over time, its essentially like meditation on steroids. It starts to recalibrate the entire neuroendocrine system. People who are running in stress mode or sympathetic overdrive start to relax that over time, and you get this bleedover effect into everyday life. Its not just what happens in the tank. It continues outside of the tank. You see heart rate normalize, hypertension normalize, cortisol normalize. Pain starts to resolve. Metabolic issues start to resolve. Anxiety, insomnia, and mental chattering can be significantly improved in 2 to 3 times per week for a total of anywhere between 3 and 7 sessions. For pain, its normally 7 to 10 sessions.'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

I recommend doing a 2hour float if people are able. TF According to Dan, most people get exponentially more benefit from a single 2hour session than 2 separate 1hour sessions. Nonetheless, 2hour floats still make me fidgety, so I routinely do 1hour sessions. Keeping it simple, Dan suggests you start with 2 to 3 floats inside of 1 month. Ive never had anybody come back and say Yeah, that didnt work. Ayahuasca or La Purga The Purge This Amazonian brew is one of Dans specialties. The experience generally lasts 4 to 7 hours. If you think of psilocybin, LSD, or peyote as different types of alcoholsay vodka, red wine, and Scotchayahuasca is more like a cocktail. This makes it hard to standardize. Just as in an Old Fashioned, there are core ingredients. In this case, they are the DMTcontaining chacruna leaf and the ayahuasca vine itself, which contains an MAO inhibitor that makes the chacruna DMT orally bioavailable. Different ayahuasqueros ayahuasca shamans will then add their own ingredients to the brew, sometimes including powerful or even dangerous plants like to similar to the North American Datura plant, containing scopolamine. No session is quite the same as any other. For me, ayahuasca has been unique among psychedelics for many reasons. In my secondever session, for example, I had the scariest experience of my life. It involved uncontrolled grand mal seizures on a floor for 2 hours, among other things. I awoke to rug burns all over my face and hands, and I was untethered from reality for the next 48 hours. Thankfully I had hired someone to watch me 247 during and after the weekend. He was able to babysit and prevent insane ideas from becoming lifedestroying actions. His repeated advice was If its really true today, it will still be true tomorrow. I havent had this extreme a reaction since, but it happened. And such a response, while not typical, is also not that uncommon. You might wonder Why would I ever use ayahuasca again after that? Heres why Over subsequent weeks, I realized that some of most critical relationships in my life had been completely repaired. I saw things differently, reacted differently, and interacted differently, as if I had been reprogrammed. Those changes all persist to this day. So, theres a huge potential upside but equally huge potential downside if taken lightly or done with the wrong people. I mention this cautionary tale because ayahuasca has become terribly trendy. Its THE thing to talk about at cocktail parties, and I shudder every time I hear something along the lines of Im going to my friends place in Manhattan for an aya ceremony this Sunday night. She mailordered some brew from Hawaii, and were doing it together. Its going to be amazing. There are now hundreds of newage folksoutthere yoga instructors, didgeridoo players, whateverwho decide to play shaman based on reading a few books, watching a few YouTube videos, or having experienced a few ceremonies themselves. I consider this all psychological Russian roulette. My suggestion is that you treat ayahuasca as if you are planning to have a brain tumor removed by a brain surgeon. Spiritually, this is effectively what youre attempting. In such a case, you would spend months, if possible, researching all of the best doctors. You would treat it like a lifeanddeath decision because of what could go wrong if it were done incorrectly. From my direct experiences, I feel like ayahuasca warrants this level of caution, respect, preparation, and due diligence. Martin elaborates Thats why its so critical to have preparation before the experience and then a period of integration afterward, because you are in this openedup and receptive state and more suggestible. Whatever habits you incorporate in the weeks afterward can stick, and these can be good or bad. DAN Ayahuasca is traditionally done in a group ceremony setting, but its a very solo, inward journey. Typically, its done in the dark, in the jungle. You go through deep, psychological healing, oftentimes preverbal healing around traumatic issues that occurred between birth and age 4. From a developmental psychological perspective, this is when most of the longterm personality traits are formed. You gain a witness perspective, the fear centers relax, the trauma is brought back up onto the screen of the mind . . . you oftentimes get this replay of very early things and can have a corrective experience. . . . Through that, I can personally see the network of interrelated factors and potentials. My mind starts to understand how things have affected me, how things are affecting the world, and potentially the next step for me to take in my journey. TF Ayahuasca is sometimes called la purga the purge, because participants often experience uncontrolled vomiting or defecating. Ive never experienced either, but'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

Whatever habits you incorporate in the weeks afterward can stick, and these can be good or bad. DAN Ayahuasca is traditionally done in a group ceremony setting, but its a very solo, inward journey. Typically, its done in the dark, in the jungle. You go through deep, psychological healing, oftentimes preverbal healing around traumatic issues that occurred between birth and age 4. From a developmental psychological perspective, this is when most of the longterm personality traits are formed. You gain a witness perspective, the fear centers relax, the trauma is brought back up onto the screen of the mind . . . you oftentimes get this replay of very early things and can have a corrective experience. . . . Through that, I can personally see the network of interrelated factors and potentials. My mind starts to understand how things have affected me, how things are affecting the world, and potentially the next step for me to take in my journey. TF Ayahuasca is sometimes called la purga the purge, because participants often experience uncontrolled vomiting or defecating. Ive never experienced either, but all of my companions have at least vomited. I was concerned at one point that I wasnt doing it right or getting maximum benefit, and the shaman assured me that purging is not a good measure of how valuable the experience is. He had only purged twice in 10 years. DAN It is very successful in helping people transition from chronic depression into what would be called euthymia, or normal mood. Many people dont even know what having a normal mood feels like but optimism, faith, courage, strength, and personal empowerment are some of its qualities. TF Ayahuasca is classically described as very visionary, or rich in visual hallucinations, though some people have more mental or kinesthetic experiences. I tend to go through it in three stages visual often overwhelming, mental intellectually able to engage and see solutions or answers, then physical. More often than not, I will cycle through these three phases during each long icaro, or song, that is sung. For the best approximation, search for Jan Kounens Ayahuasca Visions on YouTube. 5MeODMT Martin uses 5MeODMT with his patients after treating them with ibogaine and iboga. DMT is sometimes referred to as the spirit molecule, and its variant 5MeODMT is called the God molecule. 5MeODMT is found in the venom of a desert toad and is vaporized and inhaled not taken orally its toxic if ingested. It is a short 5 to 15minute experience. To put it in context, here is what the schedule might look like for a heroin addict at Martins clinic Precare for several weeks Improving diet and exercise, weaning off psychiatric meds, etc. Monday of treatment week Comprehensive medical tests in Mexico heroin addicts are switched to morphine. Wednesday night IV of saline and electrolytes, then encapsulated ibogaine, dosed at 10 to 12 mg per kg of body weight. Patients are hooked up to continuous cardiac monitoring throughout. The IV catheter is kept in with a heplock, in case atropine needs to be administered for an abnormally slow heartbeat bradycardia. Thursday Patients typically havent slept, and this is nicknamed the gray day. Addicts sometimes have residual withdrawal symptoms and feel as though theyre not benefitting. Friday Patients begin to feel better and regain their feet. If any residual withdrawal symptoms persist, iboga 300 mg capsule, then more if needed, which contains ibogaine and other alkaloids, is used. Saturday 5MeODMT administered. Postcare 2 to 3 weeks in San Diego recommended but optional. MARTIN DMT is found in ayahuasca, whereas the 5MeODMT is naturally found in certain plants and in the venom of the Sonoran Desert toad also known as the Colorado River toad, which lives in northern Mexico and southern Arizona. Its venom is thought to have been used ceremonially for hundreds, if not thousands, of years by Mexican indigenous cultures to induce states of mystical consciousness. What we like about this medicine, and what is particularly useful for drug addiction, is that it reliably occasions mystical experiences. In our patients, about 75 report experiencing an intense and profound sense of awe, divine presence, peace, joy, and bliss that transcends time and space. People often describe their 5MeO experience as one of the peak transformational and spiritual moments of their entire lives. In the body, 5MeODMT acts on the serotonin 1A and 2A receptor sites, which have been linked to mystical experiences in other psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin. However, compared to classic psychedelics, 5MeO appears to induce these experiences more consistently, and with greater potency and shorter duration. Interestingly, 5MeO is also shown to have antiinflammatory, immuneregulating, and painreducing effects because of its action at the sigma1 receptor. Our patients often report a reduction or elimination of pain as a result of their experience. Frequently people will stretch or move their bodies during sessions to work out physical and emotional tension that they may not have been aware of. By incorporating 5MeODMT into the treatment program, we can help patients who have had the ibogaine experience to feel a certain sense of release from the material that came up, as well as motivation and inspiration to move on with their life. Ibogaine can bring up a lot from the subconscious and people are overwhelmed after the experience. In a recent overview article of the research on using psychedelics to treat addiction, the depth of ones mystical experience was the greatest predictor of longterm success. When we added the 5MeODMT to our ibogaine protocol, we saw better outcomes in our patients versus ibogaine alone. TF 5MeODMT was not classified as a Schedule 1 substance in the U.S. until 2011, and its use is legal in Mexico. DAN Its extraordinarily strong in its flavor and acts as a rocket ship back to God. . . . It does take you back to source consciousness.

DAN Its extraordinarily strong in its flavor and acts as a rocket ship back to God. . . . It does take you back to source consciousness. MARTIN Addicts realize that they are divine beings, and when you have this realization that youre indestructible and infinite and divine, its very hard to put a needle in your arm and continue using. TF I have used 5MeODMT but prefer edible, longeracting psychedelics. I dont worry much about 5MeO addiction, but the rapid onset and short duration is closer in profile to substances I want to avoid such as crack. I feel its too userfriendly for my convenienceseeking personality. I like the fact that most edible wholeplant options make one slightly nauseous, have a 4 to 8hour or longer effect, and if you consume too much, you will almost certainly vomit. I view these characteristics as builtin safety mechanisms. Different strokes for different folks. IbogaIbogaine Okay, now well cover the big gun. MARTIN Iboga is an obscure psychedelic that doesnt have a long history of recreational use, because it is not a recreational experience. It is probably the least recreational psychedelic. . . . Its an African psychedelic that has been used for decades to treat opiate addiction and other types of substanceabuse disorders. TF Iboga refers to the plant, specifically a root bark, that has been taken as a rite of passage by the Bwiti followers in Gabon for centuries. Ibogaine is the primary alkaloid found in iboga. Both act as dissociatives. The effects are similar but not identical. The difference is akin to using white willow bark for inflammation versus its refined version, aspirin. Martins clinic uses ibogaine to detox patients and iboga as a booster, or supplementary medication, after the treatment. Interestingly, ibogaine appears to cause hallucinations that are mediated via muscarinic cholinergic pathways involved in dreaming and memory, as well as through the kappaopioid receptors activated also by the plant Salvia divinorum, rather than via serotonin receptors. MARTIN Who is a good candidate for ibogaine and who isnt? I get requests from people who just want to explore their psyche, or they have depression, or they want to deal with some childhood trauma. I often direct them toward ayahuasca, because I do think that ibogaine is the big gun and it is generally best used for treatment of addictions. Thats not to say that people who dont have addictions dont derive benefit from it, but I do think that there are other modalities that they should explore first that are less risky. DAN Just because something is effective doesnt mean somebody is ready for it. . . . Iboga is like Everest. Its climbing a huge mountain. Never going hiking and then starting with Everest is a bad idea. It is such an egofocused medicine. It will ride the psyche relentlessly until a person has no choice but to essentially give up and give in to the experience. They can then surrender to the greater experience of becoming who they thought they could be, or who they were maybe scared to be, freed from the limitation of something like addiction. . . . Iboga is four to five orders of magnitude superior to anything in the general psychiatric rehab arena for treating opiate addicts. You have the same level of success with using MDMAassisted therapy to treat chronic posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD. Thats why MDMA is going into Phase III trials. Psilocybin is similarly going into Phase III trials because you have such a high success rate with people going through cancerrelated endoflife transitions being relieved of anxiety, and really being able to walk through death with dignity and strength. TF Phase III trials are critically important for rescheduling psychedelics, which would make them prescribable by qualified physicians. As noted earlier, nearly all psychedelics are currently Schedule I drugs, defined by high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical treatment use in the U.S. These substances are largely nonaddictive, so the abuse claim is unfounded, but this is difficult to prove in longterm human studies given current legal constraints. Therefore, the more efficient path to prescriptionlegal is demonstrating a clear medical application for conditions such as treatmentresistant depression or endoflife anxiety in terminal cancer patients. Since quitting the investment game see page 384, Ive redirected much of my financial focus to this area. Funny aside During the 1972 presidential race, Hunter S. Thompson claimed that Democratic primary candidate Edmund Muskie was addicted to ibogaine. Hunter made the whole thing up but used it to spin the media into a tizzy. The IbogaIbogaine Experience NOTE Traditional ceremonial doses of ibogaineiboga, while incredibly promising for eliminating opiate e.g., heroin addiction in record time, can also produce fatal cardiac effects in roughly 1 out of every 300 people.

Even certain antibiotics interact with ibogaineiboga and can cause arrhythmias. For this reason, both Dan and Martin generally reserve its use for direstraits addicts, who are likelywithout a successful interventionto die prematurely from drug use or related violence. Based on notes from nonaddict friends whove done fullride iboga and microdosing, microdosing twice weekly appears to provide at least 50 of the anxiolytic anxietyreducing benefits with a tiny fraction of the risk. The typical ibogaine experience is longlastingup to 36 hours totaland has three major phases. It tends to keep patients awake for several days. Martin explains First Phase The first phase is a visionary component, which can last anywhere from 3 to 12 hours, and these hallucinations are perceived almost like watching a movie of your life. Its a life review, and people report that in the back of their eyelids they have gigantic screens where they see images from their childhood. They see opportunities they missed, people theyve hurt, and unfinished business that they need to resolve. I think being confronted with who they really are, and not being able to look away, can be difficult. Patients who are using opiates are generally trying to numb themselves. They dont want to think they dont want to feel. Ibogaine really forces them to have that discussion. Look what youve done, look where you will end up if you continue using. So it is not a fun experience. Many cases of addiction are linked to posttraumatic stress disorder. This can also be resolved with ibogaine because it allows a person to go back to that traumatic event and experience it without any emotional pain. One is able to go back and let go of the experience, come to terms with the experience, or just recontextualize the experience. Like Dr. Engle was saying, a lot of trauma that happens is preverbal. . . . The brain stores this as an emotional charge because there are no words associated with the experience. Ibogaine allows them to go back and see what happened, almost as if they were floating in the room as an observer. Because theyre seeing this experience through the eyes of an adult, it allows them to put it in a different context. Other imagery that comes up during the ibogaine experience is related to the sentience or intelligence of plant life, the creation and the fate of the universe, and our own mortality. There are certain images that can be disturbing to patients. You do see spirits and images of dead people. In Africa, they say ibogaine is a controlleddeath experience. So you go into the land of the dead, and youre given information by your ancestors, which you can then take back into this world and apply to your life. Second Phase The second phase is a phase of introspection and this can last up to 24 hours. Opiate withdrawal is pretty much gone at this point, as well as the craving. Ibogaine has a very potent antidepressant effect, so people who take it feel an elevated mood for a period of time afterward. In terms of the differences between ibogaine and ayahuasca, I think that introspective life review is more pronounced with ibogaine, although only 70 of people have it. So a full 30 experience no visions at all. I dont know the statistics with ayahuasca, but it might be more reliably psychedelic in that regard than ibogaine. Third Phase The third phase, which takes place after the clinical experience, is referred to as the temporary freedom or the window of opportunity, as noribogaine, a metabolite of ibogaine, continues to do its work for up to 3 months, making it easier for new patterns and habits to take effect. This is referred to as the integration phase, where a person takes action to fuel the necessary positive changes that were revealed through the experience. It is important to take advantage of the learning and growth opportunities in this phase, and to develop habits that will help sustain selfcontrol once noribogaine flushes out. Biochemically, Why Is Ibogaine So Oddly Effective? Ibogaine isnt just masking the withdrawal like a substitution drug would. For example, if somebody on heroin takes methadone, they wont have withdrawal for a period of time, but as soon as the methadone leaves the system, the withdrawal comes back. This is not something that happens on ibogaine. You take ibogaine, and the withdrawal is gone90 of the withdrawal is completely gone. Thats telling us that the ibogaine is actually changing the receptor to the way it was before the person started using. Its actually restructuring and healing it. Ibogaine appears to affect almost every major class of neurotransmitter, primarily via opioid, NMDA, serotonin, sigma, and nicotinic receptors. A prominent ibogaine researcher, Dr. Kenneth Alper of New York University School of Medicine, has stated in presentations that certain aspects of ibogaine defy traditional paradigms in pharmacology.

It is important to take advantage of the learning and growth opportunities in this phase, and to develop habits that will help sustain selfcontrol once noribogaine flushes out. Biochemically, Why Is Ibogaine So Oddly Effective? Ibogaine isnt just masking the withdrawal like a substitution drug would. For example, if somebody on heroin takes methadone, they wont have withdrawal for a period of time, but as soon as the methadone leaves the system, the withdrawal comes back. This is not something that happens on ibogaine. You take ibogaine, and the withdrawal is gone90 of the withdrawal is completely gone. Thats telling us that the ibogaine is actually changing the receptor to the way it was before the person started using. Its actually restructuring and healing it. Ibogaine appears to affect almost every major class of neurotransmitter, primarily via opioid, NMDA, serotonin, sigma, and nicotinic receptors. A prominent ibogaine researcher, Dr. Kenneth Alper of New York University School of Medicine, has stated in presentations that certain aspects of ibogaine defy traditional paradigms in pharmacology. TF I have noticed that microdosing seemed to increase my happiness set point by 5 to 10, to peg a number on my subjective experience. This persists for several days after consumption. Preliminarily, the effect appears to relate to upregulation of muopioid receptors. From one study . . . in vivo evidence has been provided for the possible interaction of ibogaine with opioid receptor following its metabolism to noribogaine. MARTIN In treating chemical dependency its opiatespecific. We have seen some benefits for certain psychiatric medications, but not for benzodiazepine or alcohol withdrawal. These two withdrawals are actually dangerous. When somebody gets the shakes, its DT delirium tremens and that can be deadly. So, its a very delicate process and somebody whos physically addicted to alcohol should not take ibogaine. They need to detox first, and then they can take ibogaine for the psychological and the antiaddictive benefits. Hold the GoldKeep It Close to Your Chest Following powerful healing experiences with psychedelics, Dans strong recommendation is Hold the gold. He explains Keep that experience really close and private. When it feels right to share, share it with people who are very sensitive to the fact that you just went on a strong lifealtering journey, and who are going to be supportive of that. Pick people who are not going to ridicule it or judge it or persecute it, because all of that flavors your primary experience. So many people, when they have a big experience, want to go share it, and sometimes the response they get isnt always supportive. That alters the healing that they just received.

He drinks an incredible amount of water, and he drops a small pinch of salt in his water when he can. Why? The bigger risk isnt dehydration but hyponatremia, or dangerously low concentrations of sodium in the blood. From a 2005 study by CSD Almond et al in the New England Journal of Medicine Hyponatremia has emerged as an important cause of racerelated death and lifethreatening illness among marathon runners. Kelly is a legitimate fantasy and scifi nerd. He knows Dune by Frank Herbert and The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson inside and out. For whatever reasons, many men in this book like precisely these two fiction books. Kelly has daughters and texted me about the latter book, which follows a young female protagonist How do you raise girls that are of the system but crush the system while rebuilding a better one? Boner or No Boner? Men, if you wake up and you dont have a boner, theres a problem. Yes or no? One or zero? Boner, no boner? TF Quantified self tracking doesnt need to be complicated. Its easy to miss the flashing red signal in front of your face while chasing the cutting edge of blood testing, genomics, etc. For men, the boner or no boner test is a simple but excellent indicator of sleep quality, hormonal health GH, FSH, testosterone, circadian rhythm timing, and more. The Campfire Squat Test If you cant squat all the way down to the ground with your feet and knees together, then you are missing full hip and ankle range of motion. This is the mechanism causing your hip impingement, plantar fasciitis, torn Achilles, pulled calf, etc. That is the fucking problem, and you should be obsessing about fixing this. The most dangerous sport to middleaged men is a track workout because the body is working with high force production at unfamiliar end ranges of motion. On the Overhead Squat Greg Glassman the founder of CrossFit valued it as one of the most important capacities. In fact, one of the earliest, best CrossFit workoutsI think its called Nancyis run 400 meters, and then overhead squat 95 pounds 15 times. So innocuous, right? Then repeat that sequence 5 times. What youre going to see really quickly is, everyone can fake it for 3. But then, as you start to fatigue, or your positions arent robust, you bounce off the tent. You no longer have access to compensation. The world gets really small, and then you really start suffering. . . . All were doing when we say overhead squat is Im saying Show me you can squat with your torso upright. And that looks a lot like sport, doesnt it? If you have to lean forward really far to do that, then it says you have incomplete hip and ankle function and you dont know how to create stability in your trunk. TF Doing lightweight overhead squats with a narrow stance, in combination with Cossack squats page 87, for 3 months is what helped me get 99 toward passing the campfire test above. My left ankle is still sadly bone on bone. If you cant breathe, you dont know thy position. In other words, if you cant breathe in a given position, you havent mastered it. The Top Mobilizations to Do Every Day Here are a few things you should probably do every day Everyone can benefit from something that looks like the cow stretch also sometimes called catcamel in yoga classes. Its a lowlevel static stretch that gets you into this extension pattern, and out of the other pattern of sitting in the rounded flexion position. Spend as much time in a lunge as you can. TF One simple way to check this box prior to workouts is Eric Cresseys walking Spiderman exercise. I touch my inside elbow to the ground before switching sides. This is also a gamechanger for hip flexibility in AcroYoga. Smash your gut i.e., roll on it for downregulation before bed with a medicine ball. TF This really works as a sleep aid. My favorite tool was actually designed by Kelly, the MobilityWOD Supernova 120 mm. Amelia Boone page 2 always travels with one. Internal shoulder rotation is so crucial.

It needs to be black, black as night. Soft is the solution for bedding. Todays modern human needs to sleep on a soft mattress. Ideally, you would be sleeping in a hammock. You should be waking up in the morning feeling amazing without having to loosen up your lower back. Most athletes and people are extensionsensitive because of excessive sitting and extensionbiased training e.g., running, jumping, squatting. Sleeping on a hard bed actually puts you into extension, which is the exact opposite of what you want if youre extensionsensitive. Yes, youd ideally be able to sleep on the floor and wake up feeling great, but we are not those people anymore due to excess sitting and inactivity. Kellys Mattress Checklist The softest mattress you can get your hands on is ideal, but avoid those made solely of memory foam, as it locks you into extension. Lie on a bed at a mattress store for 5 minutes. If you have to cross your feet, your bed is too hard. TF Kelly found a Stearns and Foster model works well for him. If you need to put a pillow under your legs to put you into flexion, then you need a softer bed. You should also focus on opening up hip extension. Pulse Oximeter GoNoGo Kelly uses Restwise software alongside pulse oximeters for measuring blood oxygen saturation in the morning to determine whether his athletes should exercise or not. Their technology answers the question and provides the clever tagline Am I training too hard or not hard enough? The company claims 62 world championships won by athletes using the system. There are many subtleties to the system, but here a basic observation If your pulse ox reading is 1 to 2 points lower than normal, it can indicate lung inflammation and the onset of a cold. Its best to postpone training in such cases. GoTo Multivitamin The wholefood based Nutriforce WODPak Nutriforce Sports. One Tactic for Chronic PainUse a Close Cousin of the Movement That Injured You Movement and pain get mapped. If you experience pain during a given movement for a month, for instance, its a chronic pain condition. Your brain starts to map the pain pathway with the movement motor pathway and those become conjoined. The brain starts to remember the movement that created pain got you injured, and even if there is no trauma, every time you move that particular way, you still get the pain sensation. So, one of the ways that were able to help people get out of chronic pain is to give them a new motor program e.g., dont squat with your knees in. Go Zero Drop for Your Kids Get your kids and yourself flat zero drop shoes, where the toes and heel are an equal distance from the ground. I wear Vans for this reason, my favorite model being Vans Classic SlipOn skate shoe unisex, gum sole in black. These can be used for hiking in a pinch, or worn to a business meeting when traveling light. Kelly elaborates on the rationale of zero drop Dont systematically shorten your kids heel cords Achilles with bad shoes. It results in crappy ankle range of motion in the future.

Every morning, I roll downstairs and 2 scoops of whey protein Isolyze, ice, a bunch of powdered Starbucks coffee, some macadamia nut oil, and I make a shake. Thats the start. Overcoming Jet Lag During his peak travel period, Paul traveled 260 days per year, performing in a different city each night. Here is one of his rules When I landed, I would check into the hotel. The second we checked in, Id ask them Is the gym open? Can I go train? Even if it was to get on a bike and ride for 15 minutes to reset things. I learned early that it seemed any time I did that, I didnt get jet lag. TF This absolutely seems to work, even if done at 1 a.m. and for 3 to 5 minutes. I dont know the physiological mechanism, but I use it. Is That a Dream or a Goal? Evander Holyfield said that his coach at one point told him, something like his very first day, You could be the next Muhammad Ali. Do you wanna do that? Evander said he had to ask his mom. He went home, he came back and said, I wanna do that. The coach said, Okay. Is that a dream or a goal? Because theres a difference. Id never heard it said that way, but it stuck with me. So much so that Ive said it to my kid now Is that a dream, or a goal? Because a dream is something you fantasize about that will probably never happen. A goal is something you set a plan for, work toward, and achieve. I always looked at my stuff that way. The people who were successful models to me were people who had structured goals and then put a plan in place to get to those things. I think thats what impressed me about Arnold Schwarzenegger. Its what impressed me about my fatherinlaw Vince McMahon. Worrying About It Now Isnt Going to Change a Damn Thing Im friends with Floyd Mayweather, and I was walking him to the ring one time, I think when he fought Marquez. I wanted to watch some of the undercard, and we got there early. Then his guys came and got me and said, Floyd just wanted to say hi before he starts getting ready, chat with you for a few minutes. So Stephmy wifeand I went backstage, we get in his locker room, and hes lying down on the couch watching a basketball game. He said, Hi, have a seat. Were talking a little bit, but Im trying to be ultrarespectful of him. Hes about to go into this massive fight. The second theres a lull in the conversation, I say, All right, man. Were gonna get outta your hair and head back, and well come back here when its time for us to get ready for your deal. And hes like, Man, you dont gotta take off. You can sit down. Im enjoying the conversation. Hes completely relaxed. So at another lull in the conversation, I say, Were gonna run, Floyd. I dont wanna be in your way, and he says, Hunter, Im telling you Im just chilling, watching the game. I said, Youre not wound up about this at all? and he goes, Why would I be wound up? Im either ready or Im not. Worrying about it right now aint gonna change a damn thing. Right? Whatevers gonna happen is gonna happen. Ive either done everything I can to be ready for this, or I havent. TF Whitney Cummings page 477 told me something similar, on big standup specials My work isnt done tonight. My work was done 3 months ago, and I just have to show up. One Lesson from His Early Mentor, Killer Kowalski There are a lot of things that he said to me then that I find myself telling the young guys now. . . . For example, if you dont do something well, dont do it unless you want to spend the time to improve it. Still, to this day, I see a lot of guys do stuff in the ring and think, He doesnt do that well, but he does it all the time. You shouldnt do that. TF This led me to ask myself, usually during my quarterly 8020 reviews of stress points, etc., What am I continuing to do myself that Im not good at? Improve it, eliminate it, or delegate it. Ive learned an important trick To develop foresight, you need to practice hindsight. The opposite of play isnt work. Its depression.

Recent research has demonstrated that Tetrisor Candy Crush Saga or Bejeweledcan help overwrite negative visualization, which has applications for addiction such as overeating, preventing PTSD, and, in my case, onset insomnia. As Jane explains, due to the visually intensive, problemsolving characteristics of these games You see visual flashbacks e.g., the blocks falling or the pieces swapping. They occupy the visual processing center of your brain so that you cannot imagine the thing that youre craving or obsessing over, which are also highly visual. This effect can last 3 or 4 hours. It also turns out that if you play Tetris after witnessing a traumatic event ideally within 6 hours, but its been demonstrated at 24 hours, it prevents flashbacks and lowers symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.

Also, When it comes to the future, its far more important to be imaginative than to be right by Alvin Toffler. Both are famous futurists. These quotes remind me that worldchanging ideas will seem absurd to most people, and that the most useful work I can be doing is to push the envelope of what is considered possible. If what Im doing sounds reasonable to most people, then Im not working in a space that is creative and innovative enough! What is something you believe that other people think is crazy? That you should never publicly criticize anyone or anything unless it is a matter of morals or ethics. Anything negative you say could at the very least ruin someones day, or worse, break someones heart, or simply change someone from being a future ally of yours to someone who will never forget that you were unkind or unfairly critical. Its so common today to complain or criticize others work on social media, or dogpile on someone for a perceived offense. I wont do it. Its not my job to be the worlds critic, and Id rather not rule out any future allies.

He has vetted every type of alcohol imaginable for these events, and his current favorite is rye whiskey. His recommendation in our conversation was Whistle Pig rye. Ryes are an interesting whiskey because they really were the dominant form of American whiskey preProhibition, because the industry was more northernPennsylvania, Vermont, New York, etc.where rye did really well. And then, with Prohibition and the move south with corn, bourbon exploded, which is still, by far, dominant. But rye is coming back, and I love it.

It was a really powerful, friendly way of being introduced to the complexities and wonders that were gripping to me as a kid. I watched it with my dad. It was great bonding for us. The way Sagan delivered it was just captivating, and it was really what sealed the deal for me that I wanted to be a scientist. Advice to your 30yearold self? I would say to have no fear. I mean, youve got one chance here to do amazing things, and being afraid of being wrong or making a mistake or fumbling is just not how you do something of impact. You just have to be fearless. As context, Adam said the following earlier in our conversation I want to do fundamental breakthroughs, if possible. If you have that mindset, if thats how you challenge yourself, that thats what you want to do with your life, with your small amount of time that you have here to make a difference, then the only way to do it is to do the type of research that other people would think of as risky or even foolhardy. Thats just part of the game. 5 Tools for Faster and Better Sleep As a former lifelong insomniac, Ive tried everything to fall asleep faster and remain asleep longer. Here are five tricks that work. I deliberately omitted melatonin and prescription medications, which I dont use unless adjusting to large time zone differences. I use the following in the order listed, starting 60 to 90 minutes before bed. Omit what you dont like and try what you do. Optional If I Have a Partner with Me, Acro Basing Ill put them in Folded Leaf and base them for a few minutes detailed on page 55. After a day of sitting, this will push the head of my femur back to where it should be in the hip. This isnt undone by the next step. Decompress the Spine I learned daily decompression from Jerzy Gregorek, a 60somethingyearold emigr from Poland and world record holder in Olympic weight lifting. He also wrote The Happy Body, which contains the morning mobility work that both Naval Ravikant page 546, who introduced us and I do on a neardaily basis. Jerzy considers hanging upside down mandatory after loadbearing training sessions. Keep in mind that Jerzy, at around 135 pounds body weight, can still throw hundreds of pounds overhead and land in a perfect asstoheels snatch position. Take off a little weight, and he can do the same on a wobble board Indo Board. Hes unapologetically and refreshingly nobullshit. Before my first training session with him, we sat down to have tea he only drinks Mariage Frres Marco Polo black tea and discuss goals. Midway through, he narrowed his eyes and looked me over. He reached across the table, pinched my tit, and announced, Youre too fat. My kinda guy. Below are three options, listed in increasing order of safety.

The Lynx Portable Back Stretcher or Teeter P3 Back Stretcher This is a portable gadget roughly the size of a large camera tripod. I use this several times a week, when its too much hassle after a late dinner or risk after booze to hang upside down in gravity boots. It allows you to lock in your ankles, lie down, and use a diplike movement to unlock lower back tightness. This is the fastest of the three options, but it doesnt allow you to relax your upper thoraciccervical back. If you have a human with you, the Leg Love on page 56 is a great substitute. ChiliPad This was first introduced to me by Kelly Starrett page 122 and Rick Rubin page 502. Rick and I both set it to the coldest temperature possible about 1 hour prior to bed. Lets paint a familiar scene. A man and a woman are sleeping in bed under the same set of sheets and blankets. The womans temperature is running at roughly 700F, giving off the heat of a pizza oven. The guy gets sweaty and kicks one leg out and on top of the sheets. Then he gets cold 10 minutes later and puts the leg underneath, repeating this cycle ad nauseam. He might even yank the covers like a child, upsetting the woman. Its a huge headache for everybody. Sleep temperature is highly individualized. The ChiliPad allows you to put an extremely thinalmost imperceptibly thinsheet underneath your normal sheets that circulates water through a bedside contraption at a very precise temperature of your choosing. There are versions with two zones, so two people side by side can choose different numbers. Maybe your magic sleeping temperature is 55F. Or 61F, or 75F? If youre cold, you can increase the temperature of the ChiliPad underneath you instead of throwing a thick blanket on top thats going to make your partner sweat to death. It can modulate between 55 and 110F. Experiment and find your silver bullet. Several of my close friends in Silicon Valley sheepishly admitted that, of all the advice Ive ever given in my books and podcasts, the ChiliPad had the biggest impact on their quality of life. Several others have said the same about honey ACV, described next. Honey Apple Cider Vinegar or Yogi Soothing Caramel Bedtime Tea or California Poppy Extract Your mileage may vary, but usually at least one of these will work. Honey ACV My goto tranquilizer beverage is simple 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar I use Bragg brand and 1 tablespoon honey, stirred into 1 cup of hot water. This was taught to me by the late and great Seth Roberts, PhD. Some of his readers also noticed large and immediate strength improvements in exercise after a few days of using this prebed cocktail. Yogi Soothing Caramel Bedtime Tea If youre trying to avoid sugar honey, this is an alternative. The packaging of this tea is targeted toward women to a comical degree. I recall dismissing it when an exgirlfriend first offered me some, thinking it was for menstrual cramps. A few nights later, little Timmy found himself alone craving a hot beverage with flavor. I grabbed the caramel, let it brew for 5 minutes, and polished it off. 10 minutes later, I start getting wobbly, and then I felt like Leonardo DiCaprio in the pay phone scene from The Wolf of Wall Street. In the most awkward fashion possible, I dragged my ass to the bedroom and fell asleep. It was around 9 p.m. Note This tea appears to affect only 30 of my readers this way. California Poppy Extract If both honey ACV and Yogi Bedtime Tea fail, try plan C a few drops of California poppy extract in warm water. Yogi Bedtime Tea does contain California poppy extract, but taking it directly allows you to increase the dose.

Into the Darkness Sleep Master sleep mask and Macks Pillow Soft Silicone Putty ear plugs The Sleep Master sleep maskgreat product, terrible name. Ive tried dozens of sleep masks, and this is my favorite. It was introduced to me by Jeffrey Zurofsky, who was an integral piece of The 4Hour Chef, where he appeared as JZ. Some of you may recall our food marathon, which involved 26.2 dishes in 26 different locations in Manhattan in less than 24 hours. But I digress . . . The most important feature of this mask is that it goes over your ears, not on top of them. This may seem minor, but its a huge design improvement It quiets things down, it doesnt irritate your ears, and it doesnt move around. Furthermore, it uses Velcro instead of elastic to secure the contraption to your head. Macks Silicone Putty can be used for blocking out snores, water for swimming, or just about anything irritating. Comfortable even for side sleepers, theyre soft on your ears, hard on noise.

After asking 100 interviewees about morning routines, Ive tested a lot and figured out what works for me. Here are five things that I attempt to do every morning. Realistically, if I hit three out of five, I consider myself having won the morning. And if you win the morning, you win the day. Im probably not the first person to say this, but its how I frame the importance of the first 60 to 90 minutes of the day. They facilitate or handicap the next 12 hours. Ive deliberately set a low bar for win. These will probably seem like small things, but just remember The small things are the big things. 1Make Your Bed 3 minutes In 2011 in Toronto, I chanced upon a former monk named Dandapani Dandapani.org at an event called Mastermind Talks. I was going through a very scattered period in my life and felt like my energy was traveling a millimeter outward in a million directions. For grounding, he convinced me to start making my bed. If a monk with three dots on his forehead is too much for you, I would say first Open your mind, you savage. Second, I would quote legendary Naval Admiral William McRaven, who has commanded at every level within the Special Operations community, including acting as head of Joint Special Operations Command JSOC during the Osama bin Laden raid. From his University of Texas at Austin commencement speech If you make your bed every morning, you will have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride, and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another. By the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed. Making your bed will also reinforce the fact that little things in life matter. What is making your bed to me? I use the sweepitundertherug approach. The goal is visual tidiness, not Four Seasons. I dont tuck in the sheets. I have a large blanket or duvet, and Ill use that to cover the sheets, smoothing it out. Then, I place the pillows symmetrically underneath or on top of the blanket, and Im done. Thats it. Its very simple. If you work from home, this serves double duty, especially if you work in or near your bedroom. If you see an external distraction speaking personally, you end up creating an internally distracted state. Noah Kagan page 325 and I make our beds even when at hotels. Life is also unpredictable. There are many unexpected problems that will pop up, and Ive found that two things help me sail choppy water during the day. Both are done in the morning A read a few pages of stoicism, like Marcus Aureliuss Meditations, and B control at least a few things you can control. Ill elaborate. First, for A, here is one Marcus Aurelius quote on my refrigerator that often does the trick bolding mine When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself The people'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

If you see an external distraction speaking personally, you end up creating an internally distracted state. Noah Kagan page 325 and I make our beds even when at hotels. Life is also unpredictable. There are many unexpected problems that will pop up, and Ive found that two things help me sail choppy water during the day. Both are done in the morning A read a few pages of stoicism, like Marcus Aureliuss Meditations, and B control at least a few things you can control. Ill elaborate. First, for A, here is one Marcus Aurelius quote on my refrigerator that often does the trick bolding mine When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they cant tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my ownnot of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. For more on stoicism, see page 474. Now, B control what you can control. No matter how shitty your day is, no matter how catastrophic it might become, you can make your bed. And that gives you the feeling, at least it gives me the feeling, even in a disastrous day, that Ive held on to the cliff ledge by a fingernail and I havent fallen. There is at least one thing Ive controlled, there is something that has maintained one hand on the drivers wheel of life. At the end of the day, the last experience you have is coming back to something that youve accomplished. Its hard for me to overstate how important this ritual has become, but number one Make your bed. 2Meditate 10 to 20 minutes I cover different options on page 149. At least 80 of all guests profiled in this book have a daily mindfulness practice of some type. Sometimes I will do Happy Body mobility exercises from Jerzy Gregorek introduced to me by Naval Ravikant, page 546 in place of meditation. When Im done, I walk into the kitchen and flip a switch to nearboil water about 85 of the full dial using a cheap Adagio utiliTEA electric kettle. This is for tea in step 4. 3Do 5 to 10 Reps of Something 1 minute I started doing this after numerous exchanges with the 445 a.m.rising Jocko Willink page 412. He trains before most people wake, and I train when most people are getting ready for bed like Triple H on page 128. The 5 to 10 reps here are not a workout. They are intended to state prime and wake me up. Getting into my body, even for 30 seconds, has a dramatic effect on my mood and quiets mental chatter. My preferred exercise is pushups with ring turn out RTO see page 16, as it nicely lights up the nervous system. Ill often take a 30 to 60second pure cold shower after this, la Tony Robbins page 210. 4Prepare Titanium Tea this name was a joke, but it stuck 2 to 3 minutes I prepare looseleaf tea in a Rishi glass teapot but you could use a French press. The below combo is excellent for cognition and fat loss, and I use about 1 flat teaspoon of each Puerh aged black tea Dragon well green tea or other green tea Turmeric and ginger shavings often also Rishi brand Add the hot water to your mixture and let it steep for 1 to 2 minutes. Some tea purists will get very upset and say, Damn it, Ferriss, you should really do your homework, because the steeping temperatures for those teas are all different. And the first steeping should be 15 seconds! This is all true, and I can do the fancy stuff, but when Im groggy in the morning, I dont give a shit and like my uppers simple. Explore the complexities of tea on the weekends. Roughly 185F is fine. Separately, add one of the following to your drinking mug 1 to 2 tablespoons of coconut oil, which is about 60 to 70 MCTs mediumchain triglycerides by weight or 1 scoop of Quest MCT Oil Powder, which will give the tea a creamy consistency. Pour your tea into your mug, stir to mix, and enjoy. In my case, I grab my tea, a glass of cold water, and then take a seat at my comfy acacia wood kitchen table for the next step. 5Morning Pages or 5Minute Journal 5 to 10 minutes Next up is journaling, which is not a Dear Diary situation. I use two types of journaling and alternate between them Morning Pages and The 5Minute Journal 5MJ. The former I use primarily for getting unstuck or problem solving what should I do? the latter I use for prioritizing and gratitude how should I focus and execute?. I cover the Morning Pages extensively on page 224, so Ill only describe the 5MJ here. The 5MJ is simplicity itself and hits a lot of birds with one stone 5 minutes in the morning of answering a few prompts, and then 5 minutes in the evening doing the same.

The former I use primarily for getting unstuck or problem solving what should I do? the latter I use for prioritizing and gratitude how should I focus and execute?. I cover the Morning Pages extensively on page 224, so Ill only describe the 5MJ here. The 5MJ is simplicity itself and hits a lot of birds with one stone 5 minutes in the morning of answering a few prompts, and then 5 minutes in the evening doing the same. Each prompt has three lines for three answers. To be answered in the morning I am grateful for . . . 1. 2. 3. What would make today great? 1. 2. 3. Daily affirmations. I am . . . 1. 2. 3. To be filled in at night 3 amazing things that happened today . . . 1. 2. 3. This is similar to Peter Diamandiss three wins practice see page 373. How could I have made today better? 1. 2. 3. The bolded lines are the most critical for me. Im already a checklist and execution machine. Its easy to obsess over pushing the ball forward as a typeA personality, which leads to being constantly futurefocused. If anxiety is a focus on the future, practicing appreciation, even for 2 to 3 minutes, is counterbalancing medicine. The 5MJ forces me to think about what I have, as opposed to what Im pursuing. When you answer I am grateful for . . . , I recommend considering four different categories. Otherwise, you will go on autopilot and repeat the same items day after day e.g., my healthy family, my loving dog, etc.. I certainly did this, and it defeats the purpose. What are you grateful for in the below four categories? I ask myself this every morning as I fill out the 5MJ, and I pick my favorite three for that day An old relationship that really helped you, or that you valued highly. An opportunity you have today. Perhaps thats just an opportunity to call one of your parents, or an opportunity to go to work. It doesnt have to be something large. Something great that happened yesterday, whether you experienced or witnessed it. Something simple near you or within sight. This was a recommendation from Tony Robbins. The gratitude points shouldnt all be my career and other abstract items. Temper those with something simple and concretea beautiful cloud outside the window, the coffee that youre drinking, the pen that youre using, or whatever it might be. I use Intelligent Changes bound 5Minute Journal and suggest it for convenience, but you can practice in your own notebook. Its fun and good therapy to review your p.m. amazing things answers at least once a month. Got it? My morning routine looks longer on paper than it takes in reality. Of course, there are days when life intervenes, and you have emergencies to deal with. Do I always hit all five? Absolutely not. Thats 30 of the time, at best. But you can always knock off at least one, and if you tick off three, I find the likelihood of the day being a home run infinitely greater. Mind Training 101 We do not rise to the level of our expectations. We fall to the level of our training. Archilochus The Most Consistent Pattern of All More than 80 of the worldclass performers Ive interviewed have some form of daily meditation or mindfulness practice. Both can be thought of as cultivating a presentstate awareness that helps you to be nonreactive. This applies to everyone from Arnold Schwarzenegger page 176 to Justin Boreta of The Glitch Mob page 356, and from elite athletes like Amelia Boone page 2 to writers like Maria Popova page 406. Its the most consistent pattern of them all. It is a metaskill that improves everything else. Youre starting your day by practicing focus when it doesnt matter sitting on a couch for 10 minutes so that you can focus better later when it does matter negotiation, conversation with a loved one, max deadlift, mindmelding with a Vulcan, etc.. If you want better results with less stress, fewer I should have said X mental loops, etc., meditation acts as a warm bath for the mind. Perhaps youre a worldconquering machine with elite focus, but you might need to CTFO chill the fuck out a few minutes a day before you BTFO burn the fuck out. Meditation allows me to step back and gain a witness perspective as with psychedelics, so that Im observing my thoughts instead of being tumbled by them. I can step out of the washing machine and calmly look inside it. Most of our waking hours, we feel as though were in a trench on the front lines with bullets whizzing past our heads. Through 20 minutes of consistent meditation, I can become the commander, looking out at the battlefield from a hilltop. Im able to look at a map of the territory and make highlevel decisions. These guys shouldnt even be fighting over here. What the hell is Regiment B doing over there? Call them out. We need more troops around the ridge. For objectives, we should be going after A, B, and C in that order. Ignore all the other socalled emergencies until those are handled. Great. Now, deep breath, and . . . execute.

The Buffet of Options If I could only choose one physical exercise for the body, it would probably be the hexbar deadlift or twohanded kettlebell swing. If I could only choose one exercise for the mind, it would be 10 to 20 minutes of meditation at least once daily. There are many options. Oddly, in polling readers, substantially more men end up at Transcendental Meditation TM, and substantially more women end up at vipassana. Go figure. I currently use both in a roughly 6040 split. But each person needs to find the shoe that fits. How to figure out what works best for you? Try one or more of the following. I have used each successfully and so have hundreds and often thousands of my fans Use an app like Headspace or Calm. Headspaces free Take10 will guide you for 10 minutes a day for 10 days. A number of my guests also use Headspace to help them get to sleep. Some of my listeners in the media, like Rich Feloni of Business Insider, have written entire featurelength pieces on how this app has changed their lives. Amelia Boone uses both Headspace and Calm, depending on the circumstances. I prefer the narrator for Headspace Andy Puddicombe, but Calm features background sounds of nature that soothe the nerves. Listen to a guided meditation from Sam Harris page 454 or Tara Brach page 555. Maria Popova of BrainPickings.org page 406 listens to the same recording every morningTara Brachs Smile Guided Meditation recording from the summer of 2010. Take a TM course tm.org. It will probably cost 1,000 or more, but this option offers a coach and accountability. For me, this is what kicked off more than 2 years of consistent meditation. Im not a fan of everything the TM organization does, but their training is practical and tactical. Rick Rubin and Chase Jarvis convinced me to bite the bullet on the cost when I was going through a particularly hard period in my life. Im glad they did. The social pressure of having a teacher for 4 consecutive days was exactly the incentive I needed to meditate consistently enough to establish the habit. Rick and Chase both effectively said, You can afford it, and it might help. What do you really have to lose? In this particular case, I was penny wise and pound foolish for a long time. I was also afraid of losing my edge, as if meditation would make me less aggressive or driven. That was unfounded meditation simply helps you channel drive toward the few things that matter, rather than every moving target and imaginary opponent that pops up. If you want to try mantrabased meditation without a course, you can sit and silently repeat one twosyllable word Ive used nature before for 10 to 20 minutes first thing in the morning. TM purists would call this heresy, but you can still see results. Aim for physical comfort. No crossed legs or yogalike contortion required. The default is sitting reasonably straight on a chair with your feet on the floor, hands on your thighs or in your lap, and back supported. Try one or more of ChadeMeng Tans suggested exercises, starting on page 154. They are simple and brilliant. I practice a few times per week, often in the sauna. How Long Does It Take to See Results? Macro Commit to at least one 7day cycle. I hate to say it, but I think less is worthless. There appears to be a binary notboilingboiling phase shift. If your doctor prescribes a week of antibiotics and you only take the medication for 3 days, the infection isnt fixed and youre back to square one. I believe there is a minimum effective dose for meditation, and its around 7 days. If you need a kick in the ass, consider using accountability partners or betting through a service like Coach.me or Stickk.com. Complete 7 sessions before you get ambitious with length. 10 minutes is plenty. Do NOT start with 30 to 60minute sessions, or youll quit before hitting the phase shift. Start small and rig the game so you can win. The Dalai Lama was once asked how long it took for noticeably lifechanging effects, to which he replied succinctly Around 50 hours. That really aint much, and it might be less. Based on a number of recent studies, a mere 100 minutes of cumulative sitting time appears sufficient to produce subjectively significant changes. Curiously, for some outliers like Arnold Schwarzenegger page 176, it appears that one year of diligent practice can provide a lifetime of recalibration, even if you never meditate again. Micro In my own sessions of 20 minutes, 15 minutes is letting the mud in the water settle, and the last 5 minutes are really where I feel the most benefit.

If you need a kick in the ass, consider using accountability partners or betting through a service like Coach.me or Stickk.com. Complete 7 sessions before you get ambitious with length. 10 minutes is plenty. Do NOT start with 30 to 60minute sessions, or youll quit before hitting the phase shift. Start small and rig the game so you can win. The Dalai Lama was once asked how long it took for noticeably lifechanging effects, to which he replied succinctly Around 50 hours. That really aint much, and it might be less. Based on a number of recent studies, a mere 100 minutes of cumulative sitting time appears sufficient to produce subjectively significant changes. Curiously, for some outliers like Arnold Schwarzenegger page 176, it appears that one year of diligent practice can provide a lifetime of recalibration, even if you never meditate again. Micro In my own sessions of 20 minutes, 15 minutes is letting the mud in the water settle, and the last 5 minutes are really where I feel the most benefit. For me, its much like training to failure with weight lifting. The benefits are derived from the last few reps, but you need all the preceding reps to get there. But what if you think of your todo list, past arguments, or porn for 19.5 minutes out of 20? Do you get an F in meditation? No. If you spend even a second noticing this wandering and bringing your attention back to your mantra or whatever, that is a successful session. As Tara Brach pointed out to me, the muscle youre working is bringing your attention back to something. My sessions are 99 monkey mind, but its the other 1 that matters. If youre getting frustrated, your standards are too high or your sessions are too long. Once again, for 7 days, rig the game so you can win. The goal is not to quiet the mind, which will give your brain a hyperactive tantrum the goal is to observe your thoughts. If youre replaying some bullshit in your head and notice it, just say, Thinking, thinking to yourself and return to your focus. Done consistently, my reward for meditating is getting 30 to 50 more done in a day with 50 less stress. Why? Because I have already done a warmup in recovering from distraction my morning sit.

Spirit animal Chinese dragon Three Tips from a Google Pioneer ChadeMeng Meng Tan TWFB chademeng, chademeng.com is a Google pioneer, awardwinning engineer, and bestselling author. Meng was Google employee 107 and led the creation of a groundbreaking mindfulnessbased emotional intelligence course for employees called Search Inside Yourself, which regularly had a waitlist of 6 months. Mengs work has been endorsed by President Carter, Eric Schmidt of Google, and the Dalai Lama. He is the cochair of One Billion Acts of Peace, which was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015. His book, Joy on Demand, is one of the most practical books on meditation that Ive found. Enter Meng How do you sustain your meditation practice up to the point that it becomes so compelling that its selfsustaining? I have three suggestions 1. Have a Buddy I learned this from my dear friend and mentor, Norman Fischer, whom we jokingly call the Zen Abbot of Google. We use the gym analogy. Going to the gym alone is hard, but if you have a gym buddy whom you commit to going with, youre much more likely to go regularly. Partly because you have company, and partly because this arrangement helps you encourage each other and hold each other accountable what I jokingly call mutual harassment. We suggest finding a mindfulness buddy and committing to a 15minute conversation every week, covering at least these two topics a. How am I doing with my commitment to my practice? b. What has arisen in my life that relates to my practice? We also suggest ending the conversation with the question, How did this conversation go? We instituted this in our mindfulnessbased emotional intelligence program Search Inside Yourself and found it very effective. 2. Do Less Than You Can I learned this from Mingyur Rinpoche, whose book, The Joy of Living, I most highly recommend. The idea is to do less formal practice than you are capable of. For example, if you can sit in mindfulness for 5 minutes before it feels like a chore, then dont sit for 5 minutes, just do 3 or 4 minutes, perhaps a few times a day. The reason is to keep the practice from becoming a burden. If mindfulness practice feels like a chore, its not sustainable. My friend Yvonne Ginsberg likes to say, Meditation is an indulgence. I think her insight beautifully captures the core of Rinpoches idea. Dont sit for so long that it becomes burdensome. Sit often, for short periods, and your mindfulness practice may soon feel like an indulgence. 3. Take One Breath a Day I may be the laziest mindfulness instructor in the world because I tell my students that all they need to commit to is one mindful breath a day. Just one. Breathe in and breathe out mindfully, and your commitment for the day is fulfilled. Everything else is a bonus. There are two reasons why one breath is important. The first is momentum. If you commit to one breath a day,'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

Breathe in and breathe out mindfully, and your commitment for the day is fulfilled. Everything else is a bonus. There are two reasons why one breath is important. The first is momentum. If you commit to one breath a day, you can easily fulfill this commitment and preserve the momentum of your practice. Later, when you feel ready for more, you can pick it back up easily. You can say you dont have 10 minutes today to meditate, but you cannot say you have no time for one breath, so making it a daily practice is extremely doable. The second reason is having the intention to meditate is itself a meditation. This practice encourages you to arise an intention to do something kind and beneficial for yourself daily, and over time, that selfdirected kindness becomes a valuable mental habit. When selfdirected kindness is strong, mindfulness becomes easier. Remember, my friends, never underestimate the power of one breath. Mental fitness and joy on demand both start here, with one breath. My Two Favorite Exercises from Meng, in His Own Words 1. Just Note Gone There is a simple practice that can greatly enhance your ability to notice the absence of pain whether physical, mental, or emotional, though it isnt only concerned with pain. With Just Note Gone we train the mind to notice that something previously experienced is no more. For example, at the end of a breath, notice that the breath is over. Gone. As a sound fades away, notice when it is over. Gone. At the end of a thought, notice that the thought is over. Gone. At the end of an experience of emotionjoy, anger, sadness, or anything elsenotice it is over. Gone. This practice is, without a doubt, one of the most important meditation practices of all time. Meditation master Shinzen Young said that if he were allowed to teach only one focus technique and no other, it would be this one. Here are the instructions for the informal practice of Just Note Gone, from Shinzens article The Power of Gone. Whenever all or part of a sensory experience suddenly disappears, note that. By note I mean clearly acknowledge when you detect the transition point between all of it being present and at least some of it no longer being present. If you wish, you can use a mental label to help you note. The label for any such sudden ending is Gone. If nothing vanishes for a while, thats fine. Just hang out until something does. If you start worrying about the fact that nothing is ending, note each time that thought ends. Thats a Gone. If you have a lot of mental sentences, youll have a lot of mental periodsfull stops, Gones! So what? Why should we care about whether we can detect the moment when a particular burst of mental talk, or a particular external sound, or a particular body sensation suddenly subsides? As a first step in answering this question, lets start with an admittedly extreme example. Suppose you had to go through some horrible experience that involved physical pain, emotional distress, mental confusion, and perceptual disorientation all at once. Where could you turn for safety? Where could you turn for comfort? Where could you turn for meaning? Turning toward your body wont help. Theres nothing but pain and fear there. Turning toward your mind wont help. Theres nothing but confusion and uncertainty there. Turning toward sight and sound wont help. Theres nothing but turmoil and chaos there. Under such extreme duress, is there anywhere you could turn to find relief? Yes. You could concentrate intently on the fact that each sensory insult passes. In other words, you could reverse the normal habit of turning to each new arising and instead turn to each new passing. Microrelief is constantly available. 2. LovingKindness and the Happiest Day in 7 Years In many of my public talks, I guide a very simple 10second exercise. I tell the audience members to each identify two human beings in the room and just think, I wish for this person to be happy, and I wish for that person to be happy. That is it. I remind them to not do or say anything, just thinkthis is an entirely thinking exercise. The entire exercise is just 10 seconds worth of thinking. Everybody emerges from this exercise smiling, happier than 10 seconds before. This is the joy of lovingkindness. It turns out that being on the giving end of a kind thought is rewarding in and of itself. . . . All other things being equal, to increase your happiness, all you have to do is randomly wish for somebody else to be happy. That is all. It basically takes no time and no effort. How far can you push this joy of lovingkindness? One time, I gave a public talk in a meditation center called Spirit Rock in California. As usual, I guided the audience in this 10second exercise, and just for fun, I assigned them homework. I was'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

How far can you push this joy of lovingkindness? One time, I gave a public talk in a meditation center called Spirit Rock in California. As usual, I guided the audience in this 10second exercise, and just for fun, I assigned them homework. I was speaking on a Monday evening, and the next day, Tuesday, was a work day, so I told the audience to do this exercise for Tuesday Once an hour, every hour, randomly identify two people walking past your office and secretly wish for each of them to be happy. You dont have to do or say anythingjust think, I wish for this person to be happy. And since nobody knows what youre thinking, its not embarrassingyou can do this exercise entirely in stealth. And after 10 seconds of doing that, go back to work. Thats all. On Wednesday morning that week, I received an email from a total stranger, Jane not her real name. Jane told me, I hate my job. I hate coming to work every single day. But I attended your talk on Monday, did the homework on Tuesday, and Tuesday was my happiest day in 7 years. Happiest day in 7 years. And what did it take to achieve that? It took 10 seconds of secretly wishing for two other people to be happy for 8 repetitions, a total of 80 seconds of thinking. That, my friends, is the awesome power of lovingkindness. Informal Practice Wishing for Random People to Be Happy During working hours or school hours, randomly identify two people who walk past you or who are standing or sitting around you. Secretly wish for them to be happy. Just think to yourself, I wish for this person to be happy, and I wish for that person to be happy. That is the entire practice. Dont do anything dont say anything just think. This is entirely a thinking exercise. If you prefer, you can do this at any time of the day for any amount of time. You can also do it at any other place. If there is nobody present, you can bring someone to mind for the purpose of this exercise. Formal Practice Attending to the Joy of LovingKindness Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed. Repeat this cycle once per minute Bring to mind someone for whom you can very easily feel lovingkindness. Wish for him or her to be happy. The joy of lovingkindness may arise, and if that happens, bring full attention to the joy until it fades away. For the rest of the minute, just rest the mind. When the next minute begins, start the cycle again, for a total of 3 minutes. You can do this for however many minutes you choose. You dont have to stick to a onceperminute regimenfeel free to rest your mind for as long as you want between each cycle. The timing is not important the only thing that is important is attending to the joy of lovingkindness, that is all. TF I tend to do a single 3 to 5minute session at night, thinking of three people I want to be happy, often two current friends and one old friend I havent seen in years. A mere three days into doing this in Paris, while working on this book, I found myself wondering throughout the day, Why am I so happy? Part of the reason I think its so effective is that meditation is normally a very mefocused activity, and you easily get caught in the whirlpool of thinking about your stuff. This lovingkindness drill takes the focus off of you entirelywhich, for me, immediately resolves at least 90 of the mental chatter. Coach SommerThe Single Decision We all get frustrated. I am particularly prone to frustration when I see little or no progress after several weeks of practicing something new. Despite Coach Sommers page 9 regular reminders about connectivetissue adaptations taking 200 to 210 days, after a few weeks of flailing with straddle L extensions, I was at my wits end. Even after the third workout, I had renamed them frog spaz in my workout journal because thats what I resembled while doing them a frog being electrocuted. Each week, I sent Coach Sommer videos of my workouts via Dropbox. In my accompanying notes at one point, I expressed how discouraging it was to make zero tangible progress with this exercise. Below is his email response, which I immediately saved to Evernote to review often. Its all great, but Ive bolded my favorite part. Hi Tim, Patience. Far too soon to expect strength improvements. Strength improvements for a movement like this take a minimum of 6 weeks. Any perceived improvements prior to that are simply the result of improved synaptic facilitation. In plain English, the central nervous system simply became more efficient at that particular movement with practice. This is, however, not to be confused with actual strength gains.

Despite Coach Sommers page 9 regular reminders about connectivetissue adaptations taking 200 to 210 days, after a few weeks of flailing with straddle L extensions, I was at my wits end. Even after the third workout, I had renamed them frog spaz in my workout journal because thats what I resembled while doing them a frog being electrocuted. Each week, I sent Coach Sommer videos of my workouts via Dropbox. In my accompanying notes at one point, I expressed how discouraging it was to make zero tangible progress with this exercise. Below is his email response, which I immediately saved to Evernote to review often. Its all great, but Ive bolded my favorite part. Hi Tim, Patience. Far too soon to expect strength improvements. Strength improvements for a movement like this take a minimum of 6 weeks. Any perceived improvements prior to that are simply the result of improved synaptic facilitation. In plain English, the central nervous system simply became more efficient at that particular movement with practice. This is, however, not to be confused with actual strength gains. Dealing with the temporary frustration of not making progress is an integral part of the path towards excellence. In fact, it is essential and something that every single elite athlete has had to learn to deal with. If the pursuit of excellence was easy, everyone would do it. In fact, this impatience in dealing with frustration is the primary reason that most people fail to achieve their goals. Unreasonable expectations timewise, resulting in unnecessary frustration, due to a perceived feeling of failure. Achieving the extraordinary is not a linear process. The secret is to show up, do the work, and go home. A blue collar work ethic married to indomitable will. It is literally that simple. Nothing interferes. Nothing can sway you from your purpose. Once the decision is made, simply refuse to budge. Refuse to compromise. And accept that quality longterm results require quality longterm focus. No emotion. No drama. No beating yourself up over small bumps in the road. Learn to enjoy and appreciate the process. This is especially important because you are going to spend far more time on the actual journey than with those all too brief moments of triumph at the end. Certainly celebrate the moments of triumph when they occur. More importantly, learn from defeats when they happen. In fact, if you are not encountering defeat on a fairly regular basis, you are not trying hard enough. And absolutely refuse to accept less than your best. Throw out a timeline. It will take what it takes. If the commitment is to a longterm goal and not to a series of smaller intermediate goals, then only one decision needs to be made and adhered to. Clear, simple, straightforward. Much easier to maintain than having to make small decision after small decision to stay the course when dealing with each step along the way. This provides far too many opportunities to inadvertently drift from your chosen goal. The single decision is one of the most powerful tools in the toolbox. 2 Wealthy If you set your goals ridiculously high and its a failure, you will fail above everyone elses success. James Cameron If you find yourself in a fair fight, you didnt plan your mission properly. Colonel David Hackworth Not my circus. Not my monkeys.

Spirit animal Animal crackers Chris Sacca Chris Sacca TWFBIGSC sacca, lowercasecapital.com is an earlystage investor in dozens of companies, including Twitter, Uber, Instagram, Kickstarter, and Twilio. He was the cover story of Forbess Midas issue in 2015 thanks to what will likely be the most successful venture capital fund in history, Lowercase I of Lowercase Capital. Get the name? It took me embarrassingly long. Previously, Chris was Head of Special Initiatives at Google Inc., and he is currently a recurring guest Shark on ABCs Shark Tank. Random Bits I first met Chris in 2008 at a barbecue organized by Kevin Rose page 340. For my entire life, Id had a phobia of swimming and an acute fear of drowning. This came up over wine, and Chris said, I have the answer to your prayers. He introduced me to Total Immersion swimming by Terry Laughlin, and in less than 10 days of solo training, I went from a 2length maximum of a 25yard pool to swimming more than 40 lengths per workout in sets of 2 and 4. It blew my mind, and now I swim for fun. Chris is one of the people who generously mentored me in the startup investing game. The other majors include Naval Ravikant page 546, Kevin Rose page 340, and Mike Maples, who got me started see the RealWorld MBA on page 250. Chris mentioned several books when he appeared on my podcast, including I Seem to Be a Verb by Buckminster Fuller. 48 hours later, used copies were selling for 999 on Amazon. Are You Playing Offense or Defense? Despite the fact that people refer to Chris as a Silicon Valley investor, he hasnt lived in San Francisco since 2007. Instead, he bought a cabin in rural Truckee, Tahoes lessexpensive neighbor, and moved to prime skiing and hiking country. It is no tech hotbed. Back then, Chris hadnt yet made real money in the investing game, but he had a rationale for buying the getaway I wanted to go on offense. I wanted to have the time to focus, to learn the things I wanted to learn, to build what I wanted to build, and to really invest in relationships that I wanted to grow, rather than just doing a day of coffee after coffee after coffee.

Rather, Chris invited specific founders to spend weekends at the jam pad and the jam tub the hot tub outside. He considers the cabin the best investment hes ever made Everyone loves coming to the mountains. Over the years, thats helped me build lasting friendships. Some of those have been the catalysts for my investments in Uber, Twitter, and others. Ive even had a bodyhacking, grillmanning, bestselling author stay there a few times. TF I also embarrassed myself with Eurostyle Speedos. I borrow the cash for a 3bedroom house and get a lifetimes worth of pals and a hugely successful business in return? Best trade ever. Chris elaborates Generally, what all of this comes down to is whether you are on offense or defense. I think that as you survey the challenges in your lives, its just Which of those did you assign yourself, and which of those are you doing to please someone else? Your inbox is a todo list to which anyone in the world can add an action item. I needed to get out of my inbox and back to my own todo list. Go to as Many HigherLevel Meetings as Possible TIM If working in a startup environment, what should one do or focus on to learn and improve as much as possible? CHRIS Go to all the meetings you can, even if youre not invited to them, and figure out how to be helpful. If people wonder why youre there, just start taking notes. Read all the other notes you can find on the company, and gain a general knowledge that your very limited job function may not offer you. Just make yourself useful and helpful by doing so. Thats worked for me in a few different environments, and I encourage you to try it. TF Chris was well known at Google for showing up to meetings with anyone, including the cofounders. Even if attendees looked at each other puzzled, Chris would sit down and let them know hed be taking notes for them. It worked. He got a frontrow seat to the highest levels of Google and soon became a fixture in those meetings. Cowboy Shirts Chris is known for wearing somewhat ridiculous cowboy shirts. Theyve become his signature style. Heres a bit more context, from a Forbes profile of Chris by Alex Konrad Steve Jobs had his black turtleneck. Chris Sacca has his embroidered cowboy shirt. He bought his first one, impulsively, at the Reno airport en route to a speech, and the reaction prompted him to buy out half the store on his return. He likes the brands Scully and Rockmount. A good place to look at a wide selection is VintageWesternWear.com. A shirt might seem like a small thing, but Chris realized early on that being a successful investor isnt simply knowing which companies to invest in. Part of the process is ensuring founders know who you are. If a single shirt can create seemingly unending media mentions and doesnt hurt your reputation, its lowhanging fruit. On top of that It also saved me a lot of time thinking about what to wear and a lot of money that wouldve been wasted on suits. When the Going Gets ToughTonight, I Will Be in My Bed. In 2009, Chris did a charity bicycle ride with the Trek Travel team from Santa Barbara, California, to Charleston, North Carolina I had a phrase I kept repeating in my head over and over again, which was, Tonight, I will be in my bed. Tonight, I will be in my bed. Tonight, I will be in my bed. . . . It was something I repeated to remind me that the pain of what I was going through was temporary and that, no matter what, at the end of that day, I would be in my bed that night. On the Advantage of Cultivating Beginners Mind Experience often deeply embeds the assumptions that need to be questioned in the first place. When you have a lot of experience with something, you dont notice the things that are new about it. You dont notice the idiosyncrasies that need to be tweaked.

Sweet and Sour Summers There is something my parents did, and it was pretty unique. My brother and I refer to it as The Sweet and Sour Summer. My parents would send us, for the first half of the summer, to an internship with a relative or a friend of the family who had an interesting job. So, at 12, I went and interned with my godbrother, who is a lobbyist in D.C. I would go along with him to pitch congressmen. I had one tie, and I was a pretty good writer. Id write up onepage summaries of these bills we were pitching, and Id literally sit there with these congressmen with these filthy mouthsyou know, the old Alabaman senator and stuff like thatand watch the pitch happen. It was awesome. I learned so much and developed so much confidence, and really honed my storytelling skills. But then, from there, I would come home and work in a construction outfit, in a nasty, nasty job. I mean, hosing off the equipment that had been used to fix septic systems, gassing shit up, dragging shit around in the yard, filling up propane tanks. Just being the junior guy on the totem pole, and quite literally getting my ass kicked by whichever parolee was angry at me that day. I think it was part of their master plan, which was Theres a world of cool opportunities out there for you, but lets build within you a sense of not just work ethic, but also, a little kick in the ass about why you dont wanna end up in one of those real jobs. . . . TIM You had the introduction to the godbrother, for the lobbying. Did your parents also help organize the sour part of each summer? CHRIS The guy who ran that construction company is my dads best friend, and he was under strict orders to make sure we had the roughest day there. Good Stories Always Beat Good Spreadsheets Whether you are raising money, pitching your product to customers, selling the company, or recruiting employees, never forget that underneath all the math and the MBA bullshit talk, we are all still emotionally driven human beings. We want to attach ourselves to narratives. We dont act because of equations. We follow our beliefs. We get behind leaders who stir our feelings. In the early days of your venture, if you find someone diving too deep into the numbers, that means they are struggling to find a reason to deeply care about you. Be Your Unapologetically Weird Self I gave a commencement speech in Minnesota few years ago at the Carlson School of Management. The core of it was to be your unapologetically weird self. I think authenticity is one of the most lacking things out there these days. An excerpt from that speech Weirdness is why we adore our friends. . . . Weirdness is what bonds us to our colleagues. Weirdness is what sets us apart, gets us hired. Be your unapologetically weird self. In fact, being weird may even find you the ultimate happiness. TF As an examplemullet wigs. CHRIS If you could bring one thing to make for an amazing party night, its wigs, seriously. Go to Amazon right now and order 50 mullet wigs. Mullet wigs change everything. Marc Andreessen Marc Andreessen TW pmarca, a16z.com is a legendary figure in Silicon Valley, and his creations have changed the world. Even in the epicenter of tech, its hard to find a more fascinating icon. Marc cocreated the highly influential Mosaic browser, the first widely used graphical web browser. He also cofounded Netscape, which later sold to AOL for 4.2 billion. He then cofounded Loudcloud, which sold as Opsware to HewlettPackard for 1.6 billion. Hes considered one of the founding fathers of the modern Internet, alongside pioneers like Tim BernersLee, who launched the Uniform Resource Locator URL, Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP, and early HTML standards. This all makes him one of the few humans ever to create software categories used by more than a billion people and establish multiple billiondollar companies. Marc is now cofounder and general partner of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, where he has become one of the most influential and dominant tech investors on the planet.

Hes considered one of the founding fathers of the modern Internet, alongside pioneers like Tim BernersLee, who launched the Uniform Resource Locator URL, Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP, and early HTML standards. This all makes him one of the few humans ever to create software categories used by more than a billion people and establish multiple billiondollar companies. Marc is now cofounder and general partner of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, where he has become one of the most influential and dominant tech investors on the planet. Raise Prices This was Marcs response to If you could have a billboard anywhere, what would it say? Hed put it right in the heart of San Francisco, and heres the reason The numberone theme that companies have when they really struggle is they are not charging enough for their product. It has become conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley that the way to succeed is to price your product as low as possible, under the theory that if its lowpriced, everybody can buy it, and thats how you get to volume, he said. And we just see over and over and over again people failing with that, because they get into a problem called too hungry to eat. They dont charge enough for their product to be able to afford the sales and marketing required to actually get anybody to buy it. Is your product any good if people wont pay more for it? Dont Fetishize Failure Im oldfashioned. Where I come from, people like to succeed. . . . When I was a founder, when I first started out, we didnt have the word pivot. We didnt have a fancy word for it. We just called it a fuckup. We do see companies that, literally, every time we meet them, theyve pivoted. Every time, theyre off to something new, and its like watching a rabbit go through a maze or something. Theyre never going to converge on anything because theyre never going to put the time into actually figuring it out and getting it right. See Peter Thiels thoughts on failure on page 233. The Nerds at Night Test How does Marc look for new opportunities? He has dozens of tools, but one of his heuristics is simple We call our test What do the nerds do on nights and weekends? Their day job is Oracle, Salesforce.com, Adobe or Apple or Intel or one of these companies, or an insurance company, bank or theyre a student. Whatever. Thats fine. They go do whatever they need to do to make a living. The question is Whats the hobby? Whats the thing at night or on the weekend? Then things get really interesting. StressTesting Ideas with a Red Team Each of our GPs general partners has the ability to pull the trigger on a deal without a vote or without consensus. If the person closest to the deal has a very strong degree of positive commitment and enthusiasm about it, then we should do that investment, even if everybody else in the room thinks its the stupidest thing theyve ever heard . . . however, you dont get to do that completely on your own without stresstesting. If necessary, we create a red team. Well formally create the countervailing force to argue the other side. TF To avoid the potential problem of newer hires getting battered more than senior folks, Marc and his founding partner, Ben Horowitz, make a point of smashing each other. Whenever Ben brings in a deal, I just beat the shit out of it. I might think its the best idea Ive ever heard of, but Ill just trash the crap out of it and try to get everybody else to pile on. And then, at the end of it, if hes still pounding the table saying, No, no, this is the thing . . . then we say were all in. Were all behind you. . . . Its a disagree and commit kind of culture. By the way, he does the same thing to me. Its the torture test. TF Where can you create a red team in your life to stresstest your most treasured beliefs? See Samy Kamkar, page 427 Stan McChrystal, page 435 and Jocko Willink, page 412. Always Forward Ill let the below exchange speak for itself.

Strong Views, Loosely Held For a long time, this phrase was in Marcs Twitter bio. I asked him to explain the meaning Most people go through life and never develop strong views on things, or specifically go along and buy into the consensus. One of the things I think you want to look for as both a founder and as an investor is things that are out of consensus, something very much opposed to the conventional wisdom. . . . Then, if youre going to start a company around that, if youre going to invest in that, you better have strong conviction because youre making a very big bet of time or money or both. But what happens when the world changes? What happens when something else happens? TF Thats where loosely held comes in. People everywhere hate changing their minds, but you need to be able to adapt in light of new information. Many of my friends in this book will fight you tooth and nail over a topic, perhaps making dinner company nervously glance around, but as soon as you cite better information or a better logic, theyll concede and say something like, Youre totally right. I never thought about that. Two Rules to Live By Marc and I are both huge fans of Steve Martins autobiography, Born Standing Up A Comics Life. Marc highlighted one takeaway He says the key to success is, Be so good they cant ignore you. TF Marc has another guiding tenet Smart people should make things. He says If you just have those two principlesthats a pretty good way to orient. What does your ideal day look like? The perfect day is caffeine for 10 hours, alcohol for 4. It balances everything out perfectly. TF This was said jokingly, but its surprisingly similar to my approach during crunch time. My preferred latenight Silicon Valley speedball for writing deadlines is a combination of Cruz de Malta yerba mate tea and 2 to 3 glasses of Malbec red wine. Not mixed but alternated. I sip the tea over hours with a traditional bombilla straw, taking a swig of the nectar of the gods every 5 to 10 minutes. Pro tip Your writing does not get better after the third glass. Dont Overestimate the People on Pedestals Get inside the heads of the people who made things in the past and what they were actually like, and then realize that theyre not that different from you. At the time they got started, they were kind of just like you . . . so theres nothing stopping any of the rest of us from doing the same thing. TF Both Marc and Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, have read and recommend Neal Gablers biography of Walt Disney. Marc also mentioned a Steve Jobs quote in our conversation, which is printed in full below. It was recorded in a 1995 interview conducted by the Santa Clara Valley Historical Association, while Jobs was still at NeXT Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, youll never be the same again. Study the Opposites In addition to studying his competition in tech and earlystage investing, Marc studies value investors on the completely opposite side of the spectrum, such as Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman. This doesnt mean they invest in the same types of companies rather, the synergy is related to first principles. TIM joking Youre not going to invest in Sees Candies one of Buffetts investments? MARC No. No. Absolutely not. Furthermore, every time I hear a story like Sees Candies, I want to go find the new scientific superfood candy company thats going to blow them right out of the water. Were wired completely opposite in that sense. Basically, hes betting against change. Were betting for change. When he makes a mistake, its because something changes that he didnt expect. When we make a mistake, its because something doesnt change that we thought would. We could not be more different in that way. But what both schools have in common is an orientation toward, I would say, original thinking in really being able to view things as they are as opposed to what everybody says about them, or the way theyre believed to be. Short and Sweet I followed Marc on Twitter well before we met in person. Here are a few of my favorite tweets of his, many related to the above points My goal is not to fail fast. My goal is to succeed over the long run. They are not the same thing. To do original work Its not necessary to know something nobody else knows. It is necessary to believe something few other people believe.

Nobody around them ever says, Hey, that stupid idea you just had is really stupid. Far more money has been lost by investors trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves.Peter Lynch Arnold Schwarzenegger Arnold Schwarzenegger FB arnold, TWIG Schwarzenegger, schwarzenegger.com was born in Thal, Austria in 1947, and by the age of 20 dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding, becoming the youngest person ever to win the Mr. Universe title. With his sights set on Hollywood, he emigrated to America in 1968 and went on to win five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles before retiring from competitve bodybuilding to dedicate himself to acting. Schwarzenegger, who worked under the pseudonym Arnold Strong in his first feature, had his big break in 1982 with Conan the Barbarian. To date, his films have grossed more than 3 billion worldwide. He gratefully served the people of California as the states 38th governor from 2003 to 2010. Notably, Schwarzenegger made California a world leader in renewable energy and combating climate change with the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, became the first governor in decades to invest in rebuilding Californias critical infrastructure with his Strategic Growth Plan, and instituted dynamic political reforms that stopped the centuryold practice of gerrymandering by creating an independent redistricting commission and brought political leaders closer to the center by creating an open primary system. Schwarzenegger acts as chairman of the AfterSchool AllStars, a nationwide afterschool program, and he continues his policy work through the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, which seeks to advance his vision of postpartisanship, where leaders put people over political parties and work together to find the best ideas and solutions to benefit the people they serve. Behind the Scenes Arnold is a huge chess fan and plays daily. He rotates through different partners and keeps annual score cards. By the end of a year, some of them have tallies in the thousands of games. One of his favorite documentaries is Brooklyn Castle, a film about chess in innercity schools. When I first met Arnold and we sat down at his kitchen table, I didnt know how to address him and nervously asked. He replied Well, you can address me any way you want. You can call me Governator, Governor, schnitzel, Arnold, anything. But I think Arnold will be right. I used a Zoom H6 recorder for primary audio, but I had a backup recorder Zoom H4n for our first interview. Arnold asked Whats this for? to which I replied, Backup, in case the primary fails.

Cal Fussman page 495 got the same response from Richard Branson, as no busy person wants to take 1 to 3 hours for an interview that never gets published. I Wasnt There to Compete. I Was There to Win. I brought up of a photo of Arnold at age 19, just before he won his first big competition, Junior Mr. Europe. I asked, Your face was so confident compared to every other competitor. Where did that confidence come from? He replied My confidence came from my vision. . . . I am a big believer that if you have a very clear vision of where you want to go, then the rest of it is much easier. Because you always know why you are training 5 hours a day, you always know why you are pushing and going through the pain barrier, and why you have to eat more, and why you have to struggle more, and why you have to be more disciplined. . . . I felt that I could win it, and that was what I was there for. I wasnt there to compete. I was there to win. European Brick Laying In 1971, Arnold started a brick laying company with his best friend, Franco Columbu, an Italian powerlifting, boxing, and bodybuilding champion whod lived in Germany. At the time, anything European was exotic and assumed to be better e.g., the Swedish massage craze, so they put ads in the L.A. Times for European bricklayers and masonry experts, marble experts. Building chimneys and fireplaces the European style. Franco would play the bad guy, and I played the good guy. We would go to someones house and then someone would say, Well, look at my patio.

Its all cracked. Can you guys put a new patio in here? I would say yes and then we would run out and get the tape measure, but it would be a tape measure with centimeters. No one in those days could at all figure out anything with centimeters. We would be measuring up and I would say 4 meters and 82 centimeters. They had no idea what we were talking about. We were writing up dollars and amounts and square centimeters and square meters. Then I would go to the guy and say, Its 5,000, and the guy would be in a state of shock. Hed say, Its 5,000? This is outrageous. Id say, What did you expect? and hed say, I expected like 2,000 or 3,000. Id say, Let me talk to my guy because hes really the masonry expert, but I can beat him down for you a little bit. Let me soften the meat. Then I would go to Franco and we would start arguing in German. Content in German!!! This would be going on and on, and he was screaming back at me in Italian. Then, all of a sudden, he would calm down, and I would go to the guy and say, Phew . . . okay, here it is. I could get him as low as 3,800. Can you go with that? He says, Thank you very much. I really think that youre a great man and blah, blah, blah and all this stuff. Id say, Give us half down right now and well go right away and get the cement and the bricks and everything we need for here and well start working on Monday. The guy was ecstatic. He gave us the money and we immediately went to the bank and cashed the check. We had to make sure the money was in the bank account, and then we went out and got the cement, the wheelbarrow, and all the stuff that we needed and went to work. We worked like that for 2 years very successfully. TF The content in German is really fun to listen to. Most people, myself included, had never heard Arnold speak in his native German, let alone shout insults in German. Its fantastic. Just jump to 2930 in the full episode at fourhourworkweek.comarnold Did You Hurt Your Knee? And Other Psychological Warfare By the time I came to America and started competing over here I would say to my competitors something like, Let me ask you something, do you have any knee injuries or something like that? Then they would look at me and say, No, why? I have no knee injury at all . . . my knees feel great. Why are you asking? I said, Well because your thighs look a little slimmer to me. I thought maybe you cant squat, or maybe theres some problem with leg extension. And then Id see him for all 2 hours in the gym, always going in front of the mirror and checking out his thighs. . . . People are vulnerable about those things. Naturally, when you have a competition, you use all this. You ask people if they were sick for a while. They look a little leaner. Or Did you take any salty foods lately? Because it looks like you have water retention, and it looks like youre not as ripped as you looked a week or so ago. It throws people off in an unbelievable way. How Arnold Made Millions Before He Became a Movie Star Early on I did not rely on my movie career to make a living. That was my intention, because I saw over the years, the people that worked out in the gym and that I met in the acting classes, they were all very vulnerable because they didnt have any money, and they had to take anything that was offered to them because that was their living. I didnt want to get into that situation. I felt if I was smart with real estate and took my little money that I made in bodybuilding and in seminars and selling my courses through the mail, I could save up enough to put down money for an apartment building. I realized in the 1970s that the inflation rate was very high and therefore an investment like that is unbeatable. Buildings that I would buy for 500K within the year were 800K and I put only maybe 100K down, so you made 300 on your money. . . . I quickly developed and traded up my buildings and bought more apartment buildings and office buildings on Main Street down in Santa Monica and so on. . . . I benefited from a magic decade and I became a millionaire from my real estate investments. That was before my career took off in show business and acting, which was after Conan the Barbarian.

TF This makes me think of one of my favorite negotiating maxims In negotiation, he who cares the least wins. He could ignore bit parts because he had cash flow from his real estate investments. On a related note, Arnold makes films or stars in them, but he doesnt invest in them. Hes offset the potential volatility of his own career by investing primarily in real estate. Ive taken a similar approach to date, focusing on two ends of the spectrum earlystage tech startups extremely volatile and real estate that Im happy to hold forever, if need be. Never AuditionOwn or Create a Unique Niche I never auditioned. Never. I would never go out for the regular parts because I was not a regularlooking guy, so my idea always was Everyone is going to look the same, and everyone is trying to be the blond guy in California, going to Hollywood interviews and looking somewhat athletic and cute and all this. How can I carve myself out a niche that only I have? . . . Of course, the naysayers were there, and they said, Well, you know the time for bodybuilders has passed. It was 20 years ago. You look too big, youre too monstrous, too muscular, you will never get in the movies. Thats what producers said in the beginning in Hollywood. Thats also what agents and managers said. I doubt youre going to be successful. . . . Todays idols are Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino, Woody Allen, all little guys. Those are the sex symbols. Look at you. You weigh 250 pounds or something like that. That time is over. But I felt very strongly and had a very clear vision that the time would come that someone would appreciate that. . . . Eventually the very things that the agents and the managers and the studio executives said would be a total obstacle became an asset, and my career started taking off. TF Arnold was able to use his biggest flaws as his biggest assets, in part because he could bide his time and didnt have to rush to make rent. He shared an illustrative anecdote from the Terminator set Jim Cameron said if we wouldnt have had Schwarzenegger, then we couldnt have done the movie, because only he sounded like a machine. Arnolds Most Personally Profitable Film Was . . . Twins? Twins came together because I felt very strongly that I had a very humorous side, and that if someone would be patient enough and willing to work with me as a director, that they would be able to bring that humor out of me. Arnold loved Ghostbusters, so he pursued the director, Ivan Reitman. Since most people felt a comedy with Schwarzenegger would flop, that was a blind spot they could capitalize on We sat around at a restaurant, and we made a deal on a napkin Were going to make the movie for free. We dont want to get any salaries and we get a big back end. Ivan gave it to Tom Pollock, who was then running Universal Studios. Tom Pollock said This is great, and we can make this movie for 16.5M if you guys dont take a salary and you get a big back end profit participation. Were going to give you 37 or whatever for Danny DeVito, Ivan, and me to divide among ourselves. We worked out the percentage our salaries would have been of the production budget . . . and thats how we ended up dividing up the pot amongst ourselves. Let me tell you, I made more money on that movie than any other movie, and the gift keeps on giving. Its just wonderful. Tom Pollock, after the movie came out, he says, All I can tell you is that this is what you guys did to me. Then he turned around and bent over and pulled his pockets out. Youve fucked me and cleaned me out. It was very funny. He said hed never make that deal again. The movie was a huge hit. It came out just before Christmas. Throughout Christmas and New Years, it made 3 to 4M every day, which in todays terms would be, of course, double or triple. It was just huge and went up to 129M domestically, and I think worldwide it was 269M or something like that. TF This reminded me of the deal that George Lucas crafted for Star Wars, in which the studio effectively said, Toys? Yeah, sure, whatever. You can have the toys. That was a multibilliondollar mistake that gave Lucas infinite financing for life an estimated 8,000,000,000 units sold to date.

If you can cap the downside time, capital, etc. and have the confidence, take uncrowded bets on yourself. You only need one winning lottery ticket. Meditate for a Year, Get Benefits for Life? When Arnolds movie career first began to gel, he was inundated with new opportunities and options. For the first time, he felt overly worried and anxious, due to pressures hed never felt before. By sheer coincidence, he met a Transcendental Meditation teacher at the beach. He says, Oh, Arnold, it is not uncommon. It is very common. A lot of people go through this. This is why people use Transcendental Meditation as one way of dealing with the problem. He was very good in selling it, because he didnt say that it was the only answer. He said its just one of many. The man encouraged Arnold to go to Westwood, in L.A., to take a class the following Thursday. I went up there, took a class, and I went home after that and tried it. I said to myself, Ive got to give it a shot. I did 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes at night, and I would say within 14 days, 3 weeks, I got to the point where I could really disconnect my mind and stay and find a few seconds of this connection and rejuvenate the mind and learn how to focus more and to calm down. I saw the effect right away. I was much more calm about all of the challenges that were facing me. I continued doing that for a year. By that time, I felt that, I think I have mastered this. I think that now I dont feel overwhelmed anymore. Even today, I still benefit from that because I dont merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem. I take them one challenge at a time. When I go and I study my script for a movie, then that time of day when I study my script, I dont let anything else interfere. I just concentrate on that. The other thing that Ive learned is that there are many forms of meditation in the world. Like when I study and work really hard, where it takes the ultimate amount of concentration, I can only do it for 45 minutes, maybe an hour. I also figured out that I could use my workouts as a form of meditation because I concentrate so much on the muscle, I have my mind inside the bicep when I do my curls. I have my mind inside the pectoral muscles when I do my bench press. Im really inside, and its like I gain a form of meditation, because you have no chance of thinking or concentrating on anything else at that time. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? He mentioned several people, including Warren Buffett, Elon Musk, Nelson Mandela, and Muhammad Ali, but his final addition stuck out Cincinnatus. He was an emperor in the Roman Empire. Cincinnati, the city, by the way, is named after him because he was a big idol of George Washingtons. He is a great example of success because he was asked to reluctantly step into power and become the emperor and to help, because Rome was about to get annihilated by all the wars and battles. He was a farmer. Powerful guy. He went and took on the challenge, took over Rome, took over the army, and won the war. After they won the war, he felt hed done his mission and was asked to go and be the emperor, and he gave the ring back and went back to farming. He didnt only do this once. He did it twice. When they tried to overthrow the empire from within, they asked him back and he came back. He cleaned up the mess through great, great leadership. He had tremendous leadership quality in bringing people together. And again, he gave the ring back and went back to farming.

In addition to publishing 33 books via his company Wood Egg, he is the author of Anything You Want, a collection of short life lessons that Ive read at least a dozen times. I still have an early draft with highlights and notes. Behind the Scenes Derek has read, reviewed, and rankordered 200 books at sivers.orgbooks. Theyre automatically sorted from best to worst. He is a huge fan of Charlie Munger, Warren Buffetts business partner, and introduced me to the book Seeking Wisdom From Darwin to Munger, by Peter Bevelin. He read Awaken the Giant Within by Tony Robbins page 210 when he was 18, and it changed his life. I posted the following on Facebook while writing this chapter I might need to do a second volume of my next book, 100 dedicated to the knowledge bombs of Derek Sivers. So much good stuff. Hard to cut. The most upvoted comment was from Kevin O., who said, Put a link to the podcast and have them listen. Its less than two hours, and it will change their life. Tim, you and Derek got me from call center worker to locationindependent freelancer with more negotiation power for income and benefits than I previously imagined. You both also taught me the value of enough and contentment and appreciation, as well as achievement. That made my week, and I hope this makes yours fourhourworkweek.comderek If more information was the answer, then wed all be billionaires with perfect abs. TF Its not what you know, its what you do consistently. See Tony Robbins, page 210. How to thrive in an unknowable future? Choose the plan with the most options. The best plan is the one that lets you change your plans. TF This is one of Dereks Directives, which are his oneline rules for life, distilled from hundreds of books and decades of lessons learned. Others include Be expensive see Marc Andreessen, page 170, Expect disaster see Tony Robbins, page 210, and Own as little as possible see Jason Nemer, page 46, and Kevin Kelly, page 470. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? The first answer to any question isnt much fun because its just automatic. Whats the first painting that comes to mind? Mona Lisa. Name a genius. Einstein. Whos a composer? Mozart. This is the subject of the book Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. Theres the instant, unconscious, automatic thinking and then theres the slower, conscious, rational, deliberate thinking. Im really, really into the slower thinking, breaking my automatic responses to the things in my life and slowly thinking through a more deliberate response instead. Then for the things in life where an automatic response is useful, I can create a new one consciously. What if you asked, When you think of the word successful, whos the third person that comes to mind? Why are they actually more successful than the first person that came to mind? In that case, the first would be Richard Branson, because hes the stereotype. Hes like the Mona Lisa of success to me. Honestly, you might be my second answer, but we could talk about that a different time. My third and real answer, after thinking it through, is that we cant know without knowing a persons aims. What if Richard Branson set out to live a quiet life, but like a compulsive gambler, he just cant stop creating companies? Then that changes everything, and we cant call him successful anymore. TF This is genius. Ricardo Semler, CEO and majority owner of the Brazilbased Semco Partners, practices asking Why? three times. This is true when questioning his own motives, or when tackling big projects. The rationale is identical to Dereks.

And, I think it was a 58 roundtrip bus ticket. I get to this pig show, I strap my acoustic guitar on, and I walked around a pig show playing music. I did that for about 3 hours, and took the bus home, and the next day, the booking agent called me up, and said, Hey, yeah, so you did a really good job at the pig show. . . .

The Standard Pace Is for Chumps Kimo Williams is this large, black man, a musician who attended Berklee School of Music and then stayed there to teach for a while. . . . What he taught me got me to graduate in half the time it would normally take. He said, I think you can graduate Berklee School of Music in two years instead of four. The standard pace is for chumps. The school has to organize its curricula around the lowest common denominator, so that almost no one is left out. They have to slow down, so everybody can catch up. But, he said, youre smarter than that. He said, I think you could just buy the books for those, skip the classes and then contact the department head to take the final exam to get credit. Dont Be a Donkey TIM What advice would you give to your 30yearold self? DEREK Dont be a donkey. TIM And what does that mean? DEREK Well, I meet a lot of 30yearolds who are trying to pursue many different directions at once, but not making progress in any, right? They get frustrated that the world wants them to pick one thing, because they want to do them all Why do I have to choose? I dont know what to choose! But the problem is, if youre thinking shortterm, then you act as though if you dont do them all this week, they wont happen. The solution is to think longterm. To realize that you can do one of these things for a few years, and then do another one for a few years, and then another. Youve probably heard the fable, I think its Buridans ass, about a donkey who is standing halfway between a pile of hay and a bucket of water. He just keeps looking left to the hay, and right to the water, trying to decide. Hay or water, hay or water? Hes unable to decide, so he eventually falls over and dies of both hunger and thirst. A donkey cant think of the future. If he did, hed realize he could clearly go first to drink the water, then go eat the hay. So, my advice to my 30yearold self is, dont be a donkey. You can do everything you want to do. You just need foresight and patience. Business Models Can Be Simple You Dont Need to Constantly Pivot Derek tells the story of the sophisticated origins of CD Babys business model and pricing I was living in Woodstock, New York, at the time, and there was a cute, tiny record store in town that sold consignment CDs of local musicians on the counter. So, I walked in there one day, and I said, Hey, how does it work if I wanna sell my CD here? And she said, Well, you set the selling price at whatever you want. We just keep a flat 4 per CD sold, and then just come by every week, and well pay you. So, I went home to my new website that night and wrote You set your selling price at what you want, well just keep a flat 4 per CD sold, and well pay you every week. And then, I realized that it took about 45 minutes for me to set up a new album into the system, because I had to lay the album art on the scanner, Photoshop it and crop it, fix the musicians spelling mistakes in their own bio, and all that kinda stuff. I thought 45 minutes of my time, thats worth about 25. That shows you what I was valuing my time at in those days. So, Ill charge a 25 setup fee to sign up for this thing. And, then, oooh . . . in my head, 25 and 35 dont feel very different when it comes to cost. 10 is different, and 50 is different, but 25, 35that occupies the same space in the mind. So you know what? Im gonna make it 35, that will let me give anyone a discount any time they ask. If somebodys on the phone and upset, Ill say, You know what? Let me give you a discount. So, I added in that little buffer so I could give people a discount, which they love. So 35 setup fee, 4 per CD sold, and then, Tim, for the next 10 years, that was it. That was my entire business model, generated in 5 minutes by walking down to the local record store and asking what they do. Once'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

And, then, oooh . . . in my head, 25 and 35 dont feel very different when it comes to cost. 10 is different, and 50 is different, but 25, 35that occupies the same space in the mind. So you know what? Im gonna make it 35, that will let me give anyone a discount any time they ask. If somebodys on the phone and upset, Ill say, You know what? Let me give you a discount. So, I added in that little buffer so I could give people a discount, which they love. So 35 setup fee, 4 per CD sold, and then, Tim, for the next 10 years, that was it. That was my entire business model, generated in 5 minutes by walking down to the local record store and asking what they do. Once You Have Some SuccessIf Its Not a Hell, Yes! Its a No This mantra of Dereks quickly became one of my favorite rules of thumb, and it led me to take an indefinite startup vacation starting in late 2015. I elaborate on this on page 385, but heres the origin story It was time to book the ticket for a trip hed committed to long ago, and I was thinking, Ugh. I dont really want to go to Australia right now. Im busy with other stuff. . . . I was on the phone with my friend Amber Rubarth, whos a brilliant musician, and I was lamenting about this. Shes the one who pointed out, It sounds like, from where you are, your decision is not between yes and no. You need to figure out whether youre feeling like, Fuck yeah! or No. Because most of us say yes to too much stuff, and then, we let these little, mediocre things fill our lives. . . . The problem is, when that occasional, Oh my God, hell yeah! thing comes along, you dont have enough time to give it the attention that you should, because youve said yes to too much other little, halfass stuff, right? Once I started applying this, my life just opened up. Busy Out of Control Every time people contact me, they say, Look, I know you must be incredibly busy . . . and I always think, No, Im not. Because Im in control of my time. Im on top of it. Busy, to me, seems to imply out of control. Like, Oh my God, Im so busy. I dont have any time for this shit! To me, that sounds like a person whos got no control over their life. TF Lack of time is lack of priorities. If Im busy, it is because Ive made choices that put me in that position, so Ive forbidden myself to reply to How are you? with Busy. I have no right to complain. Instead, if Im too busy, its a cue to reexamine my systems and rules. What would you put on a billboard? I really admire those places, like Vermont and So Paulo, Brazil, that ban billboards. But, I know that that wasnt really what you were asking. So, my better answer is, I think I would make a billboard that says, It Wont Make You Happy, and I would place it outside any big shopping mall or car dealer. You know what would be a fun project, actually? To buy and train thousands of parrots to say, It wont make you happy! and then let them loose in the shopping malls and superstores around the world. Thats my life mission. Anybody in? Anybody with me? Lets do it. Take 45 Minutes Instead of 43Is Your Red Face Worth It? Ive always been very TypeA, so a friend of mine got me into cycling when I was living in L.A. I lived right on the beach in Santa Monica, where theres this great bike path in the sand that goes for, I think, 25 miles. Id go onto the bike path, and I would go head down and push itjust redfaced huffing, all the way, pushing it as hard as I could. I would go all the way down to one end of the bike path and back, and then head home, and Id set my little timer when doing this. . . . I noticed it was always 43 minutes. Thats what it took me to go as fast as I could on that bike path. But I noticed that, over time, I was starting to feel less psyched about going out on the bike path. Because mentally, when I would think of it, it would feel like pain and hard work. . . . So, then I thought, You know, its not cool for me to associate negative stuff with going on the bike ride. Why dont I just chill? For once, Im gonna go on the same bike ride, and Im not going to be a complete snail, but Ill go at half of my normal pace. I got on my bike, and it was just pleasant. I went on the same bike ride, and I noticed that I was standing up, and I was looking around more. I looked into the ocean, and I saw there were these dolphins jumping in the ocean, and I went down to Marina del Rey, to my turnaround point, and I noticed in Marina del Rey, that there was a pelican that was flying above me. I looked up. I was like, Hey, a pelican! and he shit in my mouth. So, the point is I had such a nice time. It was purely pleasant.

I looked up. I was like, Hey, a pelican! and he shit in my mouth. So, the point is I had such a nice time. It was purely pleasant. There was no red face, there was no huffing. And when I got back to my usual stopping place, I looked at my watch, and it said 45 minutes. I thought, How the hell could that have been 45 minutes, as opposed to my usual 43? Theres no way. But it was right 45 minutes. That was a profound lesson that changed the way Ive approached my life ever since. . . . We could do the math, but whatever, 93somethingpercent of my huffing and puffing, and all that red face and all that stress was only for an extra 2 minutes. It was basically for nothing. . . . So, for life, I think of all of this maximizationgetting the maximum dollar out of everything, the maximum out of every second, the maximum out of every minuteyou dont need to stress about any of this stuff. Honestly, thats been my approach ever since. I do things, but I stop before anything gets stressful. . . . You notice this internal Argh. Thats my cue. I treat that like physical pain. What am I doing? I need to stop doing that thing that hurts. What is that? And, it usually means that Im just pushing too hard, or doing things that I dont really want to be doing. On Lack of Morning Routines Not only do I not have morning rituals, but theres really nothing that I do every day, except for eating or some form of writing. Heres why I get really, really, really into one thing at a time. For example, a year ago I discovered a new approach to programming my PostgreSQL database that made all of my code a lot easier. I spent 5 monthsevery waking hourjust completely immersed in this one thing. Then after 5 months, I finished that project. I took a week and I went hiking in Milford Sound in New Zealand. Totally offline. When I got back from that, I was so zennatureboy that I spent the next couple of weeks just reading books outside. Whats something you believe that other people think is crazy? Oh, thats easy. Ive got a lot of unpopular opinions. I believe alcohol tastes bad, and so do olives. Ive never tried coffee, but I dont like the smell. I believe all audio books should be read and recorded by people from Iceland, because theyve got the best accent. I believe it would be wonderful to move to a new country every 6 months for the rest of my life. I believe you shouldnt start a business unless people are asking you to. I believe Im below average. Its a deliberate, cultivated belief to compensate for our tendency to think were above average. I believe the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a masterpiece. I believe that music and people dont mix that music should be appreciated alone without seeing or knowing who the musicians are and without other people around. Just listening to music for its own sake, not listening to the people around you and not filtered through what you know about the musicians personal life. Treat Life as a Series of Experiments My recommendation is to do little tests. Try a few months of living the life you think you want, but leave yourself an exit plan, being open to the big chance that you might not like it after actually trying it. . . . The best book about this subject is Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert. His recommendation is to talk to a few people who are currently where you think you want to be and ask them for the pros and cons. Then trust their opinion since theyre right in it, not just remembering or imagining. Even when everything is going terribly, and I have no reason to be confident, I just decide to be.

Spirit animal Black bear Alexis Ohanian Alexis Ohanian TWIG alexisohanian, alexisohanian.com is perhaps best known for being a cofounder of Reddit and Hipmunk. He was in the very first class of Y Combinator, arguably the worlds most selective startup accelerator, where he is now a partner. He is an investor or advisor in more than 100 startups, an activist for digital rights e.g., SOPAPIPA, and the bestselling author of Without Their Permission. You Are a Rounding Error I had an executive at Yahoo! who brought me and Steve in for a potential acquisition discussionthis was early in Redditand told us we were a rounding error because our traffic was so small. . . . I put, You are a rounding error, on our wall in the Reddit office after that meeting as a wall of negative reinforcement for me. That ended up being kind of valuable for me and helpful, and I still am grateful to this day that he was such a dick, because it was so motivating. But I dont want to be that guy. See Amanda Palmers quote, Take the pain and wear it like a shirt on page 521. TF Reddit is now a global top50 website. You Have to Give a Lot of Damns Our site made users laugh sometimes because we had jokes in the error messages, that kind of thing. I ask people, . . . Give me an example of something that youve built into your product or your service that youre especially proud of, thats one of these touch points for someone to just go, Wow . . . if you can inject this life into your software, into the copy, into the whatever, you can connect with people. I mean, people still fucking tweet about our error message on Hipmunk, and its an error message. Why are they doing that? Because it gave them a moment of levity while they were doing something that they expected to be pretty boring, like searching for a flight. Founders have to realize the bar is set so low because most companies stopped giving a fuck so long ago. . . . Its something that I really expect other founders to do, and it ends up being pretty easy.

Productivity Tricks for the Neurotic, ManicDepressive, and Crazy Like Me This chapter was one of the harder for me to write. I drafted a portion, then Id let it sit for months. Feeling guilty, Id spend a few more hours on it, then repeat my procrastination. As a result, the lessons are spread out over a few years. Eventually, it was the below quote that helped me finish this piece, which I hope will be as helpful to you as it is embarrassing for me. The moment that you feel that, just possibly, youre walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. Thats the moment you may be starting to get it right. Neil Gaiman, University of the Arts commencement speech So, here goes, and I hope it aids at least a few of you. Reality Check Not long ago, I had a birthday party. A dozen friends and I gathered for several days of wonderful sun, beach, and catching up. On the last day, I didnt get up until 1130 a.m., knowing full well that the last remaining friends were leaving at 12 noon. I was afraid of being alone. Like a child, I hid my head under the covers literally and hit snooze until reality couldnt be postponed any further. But . . . why am I telling you this? The Dangerous Myths of Successful People We all like to appear successful a nebulous term at best and the media like to portray standouts as superheroes. Sometimes, these dramatic stories of overcoming the odds are inspiring. More often, they lead to an unhealthy kneejerk conclusion Well . . . maybe they entrepreneurartistcreator painted as superhero can do it, but Im just a normal guygirl. . . . This chapter is intended to give you a behindthescenes look at my own life. Though Ive occasionally done profiles like A Day In The Life with Morgan Spurlocks crew, I rarely let journalists follow me for a normal day. Why? Because Im no superhero. Im not even a consistent normal. In 2013, I hit a rough patch of three months, during which I Cried while watching Rudy. Repeatedly hit snooze for 1 to 3 HOURS past my planned wake time, because I simply didnt want to face the day. Considered giving everything away and moving to Montreal, Seville, or Iceland. Location varies based on what I imagine escaping. Saw a therapist for the first time, as I was convinced that I was doomed to lifelong pessimism. Used gentlemanly ahem websites to relax during the day when I clearly had urgent and important shit to do. Took my daily caffeine intake read selfmedication so high that my resting pulse was 120 beats per minute. 8 to 10 cups of coffee per day at minimum. Wore the same pair of jeans for a week straight just to have a muchneeded constant during weeks of chaos. Seems pretty dysfunctional, right? But, in the last 8 weeks of that same period, I also Increased my passive income 20. Bought my dream house. Meditated twice per day for 20 minutes per session, without fail. That marked the first time Id been able to meditate consistently. Ended up cutting my caffeine intake to nexttonothing in the last 4 weeks usually puerh tea in the morning and green tea in the afternoon.

Theyre weird, neurotic creatures who do big things DESPITE lots of selfdefeating habits and selftalk. Personally, I suck at efficiency doing things quickly. To compensate and cope, heres my 8step process for maximizing efficacy doing the right things Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen. Email is the mindkiller. Make a cup of tea I like puerh and sit down with a penpencil and paper. Write down the 3 to 5 thingsand no morethat are making you the most anxious or uncomfortable. Theyre often things that have been punted from one days todo list to the next, to the next, to the next, and so on. Most important usually equals most uncomfortable, with some chance of rejection or conflict. For each item, ask yourself If this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day? Will moving this forward make all the other todos unimportant or easier to knock off later? Put another way What, if done, will make all of the rest easier or irrelevant? Look only at the items youve answered yes to for at least one of these questions. Block out at 2 to 3 hours to focus on ONE of them for today. Let the rest of the urgent but less important stuff slide. It will still be there tomorrow. TO BE CLEAR Block out at 2 to 3 HOURS to focus on ONE of them for today. This is ONE BLOCK OF TIME. Cobbling together 10 minutes here and there to add up to 120 minutes does not work. No phone calls or social media allowed. If you get distracted or start procrastinating, dont freak out and downwardspiral just gently come back to your ONE todo. Congratulations! Thats it. This is the only way I can create big outcomes despite my neverending impulse to procrastinate, nap, and otherwise fritter away days with bullshit. If I have 10 important things to do in a day, its 100 certain nothing important will get done that day. On the other hand, I can usually handle one mustdo item and block out my lesser behaviors for 2 to 3 hours a day. It doesnt take much to seem superhuman and appear successful to nearly everyone around you. In fact, you just need one rule What you do is more important than how you do everything else, and doing something well does not make it important. If you consistently feel the counterproductive need for volume and doing lots of stuff, put these on a Postit note Being busy is a form of lazinesslazy thinking and indiscriminate action. Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions. And whendespite your best effortsyou feel like youre losing at the game of life, remember Even the best of the best sometimes feel this way. When Im in the pit of despair, I recall what iconic writer Kurt Vonnegut said about his process When I write, I feel like an armless, legless man with a crayon in his mouth. Dont overestimate the world and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think. And you are not alone. Any guy who claims hes never done this shouldnt be trusted. When you can write well, you can think well. Everyone is interesting. If youre ever bored in a conversation, the problems with you, not the other person.

This is nicknamed the Uberman protocol. Why did he stop? I got a girlfriend. We have traveled to many countries together. He takes all the photos, and I try and learn the language to translate. On one flight to Greece in 2008, I was all wound up about people pirating The 4Hour Workweek online. He asked me Why are you upset? which threw me off. Wasnt it obvious? He followed up with The people who download your book as a bad PDF arent your customers. They would never buy it in the first place. Look at it as free advertising. And with a 30second intervention, he eliminated my worrying about it. Matt is one of the people I most try to emulate. He is exceptionally calm and logical under pressure. Ive seen him face multiple datacenter collapses with nearindifference, calmly sipping beer before another billiards shot. What should I tell a hugely influential journalist asking about it? Tell him were on it. Then he sunk another ball. Hes the epitome of getting upset wont help things. I frequently ask myself What would Matt do? or What would Matt say to me? Dont Be a DogThink What If? From the early days of WordPress, we would always think Okay, if we do X today, what does that result in tomorrow, a year from now, ten years from now? The metaphor I think of the mostbecause its simpleis the dog chasing the car. What does the dog do if he catches the car? He doesnt have a plan for it. So I find it just as often on the entrepreneurial side. People dont plan for success. On Losing a 400,000 Check Matt constantly misplaces things. I have a meeting and I spend 10 minutes looking for my wallet because I just stuck it someplace. Its in the fridge or something. I dont know. Im always losing something. Actually, I lost one of our initial investment checks. It was a check for 400,000. TIM Thats not good to lose. MATT It was investor Phil Black, whos still on the board today, and he wrote a paper check, like the kind you would use at the grocery store or for normal things. The most money Id ever seen in my life. I was 20 years old. I was like What is this? I expected it to be a check like a Publishers Clearing House, you know? Like the size of a table. TIM Right, that you could surf like a floating carpet from Aladdin down to the bank. MATT Luckily, the other investors wired their money because I misplaced this check. And I was thinking, Oh, my goodness, what do I do in this situation? Because obviously, he could stop the check, but then hes just entrusted me with 400,000 and Ive lost it. Do I tell him? Do I not tell him? Is he going to notice at some point? And months passed. Literally months passed. He doesnt say anything, I dont say anything. TIM Because you didnt want to ask him. MATT I didnt ask him. And Im going back to Houston for Thanksgiving, and I open the book Im reading and I had used it as a bookmark. And it kind of fell out of the book on the plane. I was like Oh, my goodness! The Tail End On a hike in San Francisco, Matt recommended I read The Tail End by Tim Urban on the Wait But Why blogif you only read one article this month, make it that one. It uses diagrams to underscore how short life really is. Heres just one gem It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93 of my inperson parent time. Im now enjoying the last 5 of that time. Were in the tail end. Might be time for you and me to rethink our personal priorities. On a related and sad note, Matts father passed away unexpectedly weeks after he recommended this article to me. Matt was at his bedside. Qwerty Is for Junior Varsity The normal QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow down human operators to avoid jams. That time has passed, so try the Dvorak layout instead, which is easier on your tendons and helps prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. Read The Dvorak Zine dvzine.org. Colemak is even more efficient, if you dare. Within Automattic, Matt has held speedtyping challenges, where the loser has to switch to the winners layout. So far, Dvorak has always beaten QWERTY. On Getting the Ma.tt Domain Name I had to wire money several grand to Trinidad and Tobago. I was in the Bank of America, and they said, Sir, are you sure about this? I was like, Yeah, yeah, its fine.

Im now enjoying the last 5 of that time. Were in the tail end. Might be time for you and me to rethink our personal priorities. On a related and sad note, Matts father passed away unexpectedly weeks after he recommended this article to me. Matt was at his bedside. Qwerty Is for Junior Varsity The normal QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow down human operators to avoid jams. That time has passed, so try the Dvorak layout instead, which is easier on your tendons and helps prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. Read The Dvorak Zine dvzine.org. Colemak is even more efficient, if you dare. Within Automattic, Matt has held speedtyping challenges, where the loser has to switch to the winners layout. So far, Dvorak has always beaten QWERTY. On Getting the Ma.tt Domain Name I had to wire money several grand to Trinidad and Tobago. I was in the Bank of America, and they said, Sir, are you sure about this? I was like, Yeah, yeah, its fine.

Telegram a messaging app with really good encryption Calm.com for meditation How Matt Got in Shape He committed to one pushup before bed. Yes, just one pushup No matter how late youre running, no matter whats going on in the world, you cant argue against doing one pushup. Come on. Theres no excuse. I often find I just need to get over that initial hump with something thats almost embarrassingly small as a goal, and then that can become a habit. TF Remember ChadeMeng Tans one breath on page 155? Same idea. Fully Text, Fully Distributed Automattic has more than 500 employees and is fully distributed across more than 50 countries. They have almost no inperson or phone meetings. There is no headquarters, so to speak. They skip the offices, hire the best talent worldwide, and spend the savings on 250 per month coworking stipends and other benefits. The interview process is as much like the actual work as possible. Its all email or text chat, because thats how we primarily communicate. It also prevents you from any subconscious bias. TIM What do you look for or disqualify against? MATT I look for a passion, attention to detail, drive beyond the things that they need to do. Im totally down with quirky. TIM What questions do you ask to get an indication of those things? MATT So at this point in the early stages all Im doing is looking at emails. So literally theres no chat, no anything. Its purely based on the care and effort that they put into this email. Weve tried forms and things they fill out before, and weve gone back to just a freeform email because I want to see what kind of attachment they use. I want to see who their email client is. I want to see if you can tell theyve copied and pasted things because of different text and different font sizes. All of those are indicators, and not any one of them alone. You know something I can say, you asked about what we look for in candidates clarity of writing. I think clarity of writing indicates clarity of thinking. TF I highly recommend reading The CEO of Automattic on Holding Auditions to Build a Strong Team from the April 2014 issue of the Harvard Business Review find it on hbr.org. Words That Work Matt pays incredible attention to word choice and ordering diction and syntax. He loves studying code poetscoders who have elegant, poetic stylebut he does the same with spoken language. He recommended I read the book Words That Work, written by Republican political strategist Frank Luntz. Its brilliant. Matt added, If someone likes that book, then I might point them to George Lakoff. He has a great seminal work from the 1980s called Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things. He loves books about framing and language. Advice to your 20yearold self? Slow down. I think a lot of the mistakes of my youth were mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth. So just slowing down, whether thats meditating, whether thats taking time for yourself away from screens, whether thats really focusing in on who youre talking to or who youre with. 104 Chicken McNuggets The Super Bowl was in Houston, Texas in 2004.

Nicholas has now performed extensively throughout the world, including playing alongside Coldplay and giving a rendition of the Paralympic Anthem in front of an inperson audience of 86,000 people and half a billion worldwide TV viewers.

Lacking a diffuser, I started by dabbing a bit on my wrists and then rubbing it on my neck near my ears. Placebo or not, I felt noticeably more stamina. I later purchased an InnoGear 200 ml aromatherapy diffuser in wood grain most diffusers look cheap otherwise for home use.

He agonized over the 35 decision, as he was making 40 a week as a janitor, but Jim gave Tonys life direction. Decades later, when Tony asked Warren Buffett what his alltime best investment was, the answer was a Dale Carnegie public speaking course, taken at age 20. Prior to that, Buffett would vomit before public speaking. After the courseand this is the critical pieceBuffett immediately went to the University of Omaha and asked to teach, as he didnt want to lapse back into his old behaviors. As Tony recounted, Buffett told him, Investing in yourself is the most important investment youll ever make in your life. . . . Theres no financial investment thatll ever match it, because if you develop more skill, more ability, more insight, more capacity, thats whats going to really provide economic freedom. . . . Its those skill sets that really make that happen. This echoes what Jim Rohn famously said, If you let your learning lead to knowledge, you become a fool. If you let your learning lead to action, you become wealthy. Quality Questions Create a Quality Life Tony sometimes phrases this as, The quality of your life is the quality of your questions. Questions determine your focus. Most peopleand Im certainly guilty of this at timesspend their lives focusing on negativity e.g., How could he say that to me?! and therefore the wrong priorities. A Focus on Me Suffering This brain inside our heads is a 2 millionyearold brain. . . . Its ancient, old survival software that is running you a good deal of time. Whenever youre suffering, that survival software is there. The reason youre suffering is youre focused on yourself. People tell me, Im not suffering that way. Im worrying about my kids. My kids are not what they need to be. No, the reason these people are upset is they feel they failed their kids. Its still about them. . . . Suffering comes from three thought patterns loss, less, never. TF The bolded portion above, combined with another friends advice, changed my life. It took a while for me to connect the dots. I dont think Im a complete narcissist too bald and pale for that, but I still wondered how to put this into a concrete daily practice. Then, I learned the dead simple lovingkindness meditation exercise from my friend ChadeMeng Tan page 157, which had a profound effect after just 3 to 4 days. Try it. State Story Strategy I learned this from my first Tony Robbins event, Unleash the Power Within UPW, which Tony invited me to after our first podcast. Perhaps more than any other lesson from Tony, Ive thought about this the most in the last year. If you were to look at my daily journal right now, youd see that Ive scribbled STATE STORY STRATEGY at the top of each page for the next several weeks. Its a reminder to check the boxes in that order. Tony believes that, in a lowered emotional state, we only see the problems, not solutions. Lets say you wake up feeling tired and overwhelmed. You sit down to brainstorm strategies to solve your issues, but it comes to naught, and you feel even worse afterward. This is because you started in a negative state, then attempted strategy but didnt succeed due to tunnel vision on the problems, and then likely told yourself selfdefeating stories e.g., I always do this. Why am I so wound up I cant even think straight?. To fix this, he encourages you to prime your state first. The biochemistry will help you proactively tell yourself an enabling story.

Morning Priming Instead of Meditation Upon waking, Tony immediately goes into his priming routine, which is intended to produce a rapid change in his physiology To me, if you want a primetime life, youve got to prime daily. There are many tools that Ive seen Tony use over the years, several of which Ive adopted for myself, including Coldwater plunge I use a quick cold shower, which could be just 30 to 60 seconds Tony follows this with breathing exercises. He does 3 sets of 30 reps. His seated technique is similar to the rapid nasal breath of fire in yoga, but he adds in rapid overhead extension of the arms on the inhale, with the elbows dropping down the rib cage on the exhale. Alternative Breath walking. This is vintage Tony, but I still use it quite often when traveling. Simply walk for a few minutes, using a breathing cycle of 4 short inhales through the nose, then 4 short exhales through the mouth. Following something like the above, Tony does 9 to 10 minutes of what some might consider meditation. To him, however, the objective is very different Its about cueing and prompting enabling emotions for the rest of the day. His 9 to 10 minutes are broken into thirds. Here is an abbreviated synopsis The first 3 minutes Feeling totally grateful for three things. I make sure that one of them is very, very simple the wind on my face, the reflection of the clouds that I just saw. But I dont just think gratitude. I let gratitude fill my soul, because when youre grateful, we all know theres no anger. Its impossible to be angry and grateful simultaneously. When youre grateful, there is no fear. You cant be fearful and grateful simultaneously. The second 3 minutes Total focus on feeling the presence of God, if you will, however you want to language that for yourself. But this inner presence coming in, and feeling it heal everything in my body, in my mind, my emotions, my relationships, my finances. I see it as solving anything that needs to be solved. I experience the strengthening of my gratitude, of my conviction, of my passion. . . . The last 3 minutes Focusing on three things that Im going to make happen, my three to thrive. . . . See it as though its already been done, feel the emotions, etc. . . . And, as Ive always said, theres no excuse not to do 10 minutes. If you dont have 10 minutes, you dont have a life. This reminded me of something Ive heard from many adept meditators such as Russell Simmons in various forms If you dont have 20 minutes to delve into yourself through meditation, then that means you really need 2 hours. Four Commonalities Across the Best Investors Tony has interviewed and developed friendships with some of the best investors in the world, including Paul Tudor Jones who hes coached for more than 10 years, Ray Dalio, Carl Icahn, David Swensen, Kyle Bass, and many more. These are the hardtointerview unicorns who consistently beat the market, despite the fact that its called impossible. Tony wrote a book based on his learnings Money Master the Game, and here are few of the patterns he identified Capping the downside Every single one of those people is obsessed with not losing money. I mean, a level of obsession thats mindboggling. On Richard Branson His first question to every business is, Whats the downside? And how do I protect against it? Like when he did his piece with Virgin air travelthats a big risk to start an airlinehe went to Boeing and negotiated a deal that he could send the planes back if it didnt work, and he wasnt liable. TF Branson also tested with little or no risk. In Losing My Virginity, which had a huge impact on me around college graduation, he described his very first flight We were trying to catch a flight to Puerto Rico, but the local Puerto Rican scheduled flight was canceled. The airport terminal was full of stranded passengers. I made a few calls to charter companies, and agreed to charter a plane for 2,000 to Puerto Rico. I divided the price by the number of seats, borrowed a blackboard, and wrote virgin airways 39 single flight to puerto rico. I walked around the airport terminal and soon filled every seat on the charter plane. As we landed in Puerto Rico, a passenger turned to me and said Virgin Airways isnt too badsmarten up the service a little and you could be in business. Back to Tony, cap the downside also applies to thinking longterm about fees and middlemen If three of my friends and I all put aside the same amount of money, and we all get a 7 return, but my buddys getting fees of 3, my other buddys 2, and Im 1, and all three of us put 1 million in or 100,000 . . . the person with 3 of fees ends up with 65 less money'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

Asymmetrical risks and rewards Every single one of them is obsessed with asymmetrical risk and reward. . . . It simply means theyre looking to use the least amount of risk to get the max amount of upside, and thats what they live for. . . . They dont believe they have to take huge risks for huge rewards. Say, How do I get no risk and get huge rewards? and because you ask a question continuously and you believe theres an answer, you get it. TF Heres a wild example. Kyle Bass at one point bought 1 million worth of nickels roughly 20 million coins. Why? Because their face value was 5 cents and their scrap metal value was 6.8 cents at the time. Thats an immediate gain of 360,000. Nicely done. Asset allocation They absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, know theyre going to be wrong . . . so they set up an asset allocation system that will make them successful. They all agree asset allocation is the single most important investment decision. In Money Master the Game, Ray Dalio elaborated for Tony When people think theyve got a balanced portfolio, stocks are three times more volatile than bonds. So when youre 5050, youre really 9010. You really are massively at risk, and thats why when the markets go down, you get eaten alive. . . . Whatever asset class you invest in, I promise you, in your lifetime, it will drop no less than 50 and more likely 70 at some point. That is why you absolutely must diversify. Contribution And the last one that I found almost all of them were real givers, not just givers on the surface . . . but really passionate about giving. . . . It was really real. TF One great example is the Robin Hood Foundation, conceived of by Paul Tudor Jones, which fights poverty in New York City. Who comes to mind when I say the word punchable? For a few dozen podcast episodes, I asked the question When you think of the word punchable, whose face is the first that comes to mind? Nine times out of ten, it fell flat, and Ive since stopped asking it. But in my interview with Tony, all of those flops were redeemed. He took a long pause and then said, Punchable. Oh, my gosh. Well, I had an interesting meeting with President Obama . . . and proceeded to describe a closedsession conversation with President Obama you can hear the full story at 4215 in episode 38. It was one of those God, I really hope my audio equipment is working moments. He closed it with So, I dont know if Id say punch, but shake him. Mostgifted or recommended books?

Follow What Angers You Casey made the short film Bike Lanes in 2011, and it became his first viral hit. He was given a summons from a New York City police officer for riding his bike outside of the bike lane, which isnt an actual infraction. Instead of going to court, fighting the 50 summons, and wasting half a day in the process, Casey redirected his anger and made a movie that expressed his frustration in a clever way. Casey begins the movie by repeating what the cop told him He has to stay in the bike lane for safety and legal reasons, no matter what. Casey proceeds to ride his bike around NYC, crashing into everything that is in the bike lanes preventing people from following this rule. The films grand finale is Casey crashing into a police car that was truly parked in the middle of a bike lane. His movie went tremendously viral and was seen around 5 million times in its first day. At one point, Mayor Bloomberg had to respond to a question about the video in a press conference.

I loved making them. But when it came time to make the third movie, I was really burnt out from the process. At the ninth hour, I called my editor up and said, Hey, lets not make this advertisement. Instead, lets do something Ive always wanted to do, which is Lets just take the entire production budget and travel the world until we run out of money, and well record that. Well make some sort of movie about that. And he said, Youre crazy, but sure. The Make It Count video literally opens with scrolling text that says, Nike asked me to make a movie about what it means to make it count. Instead of making their movie, I spent the entire budget traveling around the world with my friend Max. Wed keep going until the money ran out. It took 10 days. They covered 15 countries. Make It Count became a video about chasing what matters to you. This was the entire message and point of the campaign to begin with. Make It Count ended up being Nikes most watched video on the Internet for several years. TF How can you make your bucketlist dreams pay for themselves by sharing them? This is, in effect, how Ive crafted my entire career since 2004.

Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? My grandmother. She passed away at 92. Shes my hero, shes my muse, shes my everything. She started tap dancing when she was 6 years old. She was a little fat girl and her parents made her do something to lose the weight, so she started tap dancing, and she loved it. She fell in love with something at age 6 and she didnt stop tap dancing until the day before she died at age 92. She died on a Monday morning, and the first thing we had to do was call her 100 students to say she wasnt going to make class that day. What is the ultimate quantification of success? For me, its not how much time you spend doing what you love. Its how little time you spend doing what you hate. And this woman spent all day, every day doing what she loved.

How Super Size Me Came to Be I was sitting on my moms couch in a spectacular tryptophan haze, when a news story came on about these two girls who were suing McDonalds. These girls said, Were fat, were sick, and its your fault. I thought, Come on, thats crazy. Youre going to sue somebody for selling you food that you bought, that you ate, and then blame them for it? How can you do that? Then a spokesperson for McDonalds came on and said, You cant link our food to these girls being sick. You cant link our food to these girls being obese. Our food is healthy. Its nutritious. Its good for you. I thought, I dont know if you can say that either. . . . If its that good for me, then shouldnt I be able to eat it for 30 days straight with no side effects? And I was like Thats it. TF Is there a common saying, or some public pronouncement, that you can disprove by making art about it? By doing a test? What makes you angry?

But what on earth did they write about? Perhaps youve seen excerpts of their private journals and thought to yourself, Goddamn, that reads like the Gettysburg Address! and become demoralized. In this chapter, Ill show you what my raw morning journal looks like and describe its function. Why? Because its messy, and seeing the mess can be encouraging. Its easy to imagine our heroes as unflappable juggernauts, who conquer insecurity with a majestic mental karate chop every morning. This is, of course, a fantasy. Most people you see on magazine covers have plenty of mornings when theyd rather hide under the covers all day long. If you want to be wealthyas measured in money, time, relationships, ease of sleep, or otherwisespiritual windshield wipers will help you get there with fewer accidents and less headache. Let me explain. . . . The Daily Struggle Nearly every morning, I sit down with a hot cocktail of turmeric, ginger, puerh tea, and green tea. Next, I crack open The Artists Way Morning Pages Journal by Julia Cameron. The original Artists Way was first recommended to me by screenwriter and producer Brian Koppelman page 613, so hes to thank for this practice in my life. But I largely skipped the originalperhaps unfairlyas more book consumption didnt interest me. I often use reading to procrastinate. What I needed was a daily and meditative practice of production, like a tea ceremony. So, voil, I bought the journal. This companion provides plenty of context to be used by itself. To be clear, I dont journal to be productive. I dont do it to find great ideas, or to put down prose I can later publish. The pages arent intended for anyone but me. Morning pages are, as author Julia Cameron puts it, spiritual windshield wipers. Its the most costeffective therapy Ive ever found. To quote her further, from page viii Once we get those muddy, maddening, confusing thoughts nebulous worries, jitters, and preoccupations on the page, we face our day with clearer eyes. Please reread the above quote. It may be the most important aspect of trapping thought on paper i.e., writing youll ever encounter. Even if you consider yourself a terrible writer, writing can be viewed as a tool. There are huge benefits to writing, even if no oneyourself includedever reads what you write. In other words, the process matters more than the product. Below is one of my real entries, which Ive typed out for easier readability. SUNDAY, DEC. 28, NEW YORK Woke up at 730 a.m., before everyone else. Feels great. Its a Sunday, so I feel I can take it slow, which is probably the reason it feels great.

Or is it because you feel you must be defensive and protect what you have time, money, relationships, space, etc.? For someone whos won through a lifetime of offense, of attacking, playing the defensive game conflicts with the core of who they are. So . . . Whats the Point Again? There are two ways to interpret the above journal entry, and theyre not mutually exclusive 1. Im trying to figure things out, and this might help. For instance Ive identified conflicts between goals become successful in some respect and related sideeffects 100x more inbound, which negate the benefits. Ive also noted that my big wins in life have come from being aggressive, much like iconic coach Dan Gable, whose epic rants in the hardtofind doc Competitor Supreme are worth finding. But the fetters of even moderate success makes one feel like they have to play defense, or manage instead of conquer. This runs counter to my DNA, which leads to unhappiness. Therefore, I need to divest myself of assets that require protecting, or I need to better delegate this responsibility. That all sounds pleasantly analytical. Arent we smart? But perhaps the real value is that . . . 2. Im just caging my monkey mind on paper so I can get on with my fucking day. If you take nothing from this chapter but 2 above and the next few lines, Ill consider my mission accomplished. Morning pages dont need to solve your problems. They simply need to get them out of your head, where theyll otherwise bounce around all day like a bullet ricocheting inside your skull. Could bitching and moaning on paper for 5 minutes each morning change your life? As crazy as it seems, I believe the answer is yes. Reid Hoffman Reid Hoffman LITW reidhoffman, reidhoffman.org is often referred to as The Oracle of Silicon Valley by tech insiders, who look at his companybuilding and investing track record Facebook, Airbnb, Flickr, etc. with awe. Reid is cofounder and executive chairman of LinkedIn, which has more than 300 million users and was sold to Microsoft for 26.2 billion in cash. He was previously executive vice president at PayPal, which was purchased by eBay for 1.5 billion. He has a masters degree in philosophy from Oxford, where he was a Marshall Scholar. Behind the Scenes Reid, along with Matt Mullenweg page 202, is one of the calmest people Ive ever met. His former chief of staff has told stories of Reid responding to an insult with Im perfectly willing to accept that and moving on. Reid was nicknamed firefighter in chief at PayPal by thenCEO Peter Thiel. Reid and I are both on the advisory board of QuestBridge, where he is the chair. QuestBridge supplies more exceptional lowincome talent i.e., kids to top universities than all other nonprofits combined. QuestBridge has created a single standardized college application thats accepted by more than 30 top universities like Stanford, MIT, Amherst, and Yale. This allows them to do some very innovative things, such as give away laptops and have the giveaway forms double as college applications. They then offer scholarships to many kids who could otherwise not even think of college. Did you know that roughly 3 billion available for scholarships goes wasted each year? Its not a funding problem Its a sourcing problem. What Billy Beane of the Oakland As and Moneyball fame was to baseball, QuestBridge is to college education. How REID Developed the Ability to Deconstruct Problems and Interact with Many Stakeholders at Once Credit Card Processors, Banks, Regulators, Etc. I think the most fundamental was, as a child, I played a lot of Avalon Hill board games, and each board game is actually a complex set of rules and circumstances. Reid also read Carl von Clausewitz and Sun Tzu as a boy, which informed his strategic thinking. For the PhilosophyPhobic, One Philosopher to Start With Reid recommends studying Ludwig Wittgenstein, about whom hes taught a course at Oxford. One of the bedrocks of modern analytic philosophy is to think of language . . . if youre trying to talk to someone else about some problem, and youre trying to make progress, how do you make language as positive an instrument as possible?

Give the Mind an Overnight Task On a daily basis, Reid jots down problems in a notebook that he wants his mind to work on overnight. Bolding below is mine, as I think the wording is important. Note might have instead of have, etc. What are the kinds of key things that might be constraints on a solution, or might be the attributes of a solution, and what are tools or assets I might have? . . . I actually think most of our thinking, of course, is subconscious. Part of what Im trying to do is allow the fact that we have this kind of relaxation, rejuvenation period in sleeping, to essentially possibly bubble up the thoughts and solutions to it. He might write down a key thing that I want to think about a product design, a strategy, a solution to a problem that one of my portfolio companies is looking at, or something else he wants to solve creatively before an upcoming meeting. Josh Waitzkin page 577 has a nearidentical habit, but hes particular about when he writes things downright after dinner and not before bed. To Josh, the presleep gestation period of a few hours is important, as he doesnt want to be consciously thinking about the problem when he gets under the sheets. Josh and Reid also mirror each other upon waking. Ideally, Reid budgets 60 minutes for the following The very first thing I do when I get up, almost always, is to sit down and work on that problem Ive set the day before because thats when Im freshest. Im not distracted by phone calls and responses to things, and so forth. Its the most tabula rasablank slatemoment that I have. I use that to maximize my creativity on a particular project. Ill usually do it before I shower, because frequently, if I go into the shower, Ill continue to think about it. TF Reid and Joshs descriptions led me to put the following quote at the top of my notebook Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious.Thomas Edison Additional Lessons from Ben Casnocha FB Casnocha, Reids Former Chief of Staff Reids First Principle Is Speed We agreed I was going to make judgment calls on a range of issues on his behalf without checking with him. He told me, In order to move fast, I expect youll make some foot faults. Im okay with an error rate of 10 to 20times when I would have made a different decision in a given situationif it means you can move fast. I felt empowered to make decisions with this ratio in mind, and it was incredibly liberating. TF Foot faults is a metaphor here. Foot fault literally refers to a penalty in tennis when you serve with improper foot placement, often due to rushing. On Vetting the Best Employees or Partners How do you know if you have Aplayers on your project team? You know it if they dont just accept the strategy you hand them. They should suggest modifications to the plan based on their closeness to the details. Reid Seeks a Single Reason for a Potentially Expensive ActionNot a Blended Reason For example, we were once discussing whether itd make sense for him to travel to China. There was the LinkedIn expansion activity in China, some fun intellectual events happening, the launch of The StartUp of You Reids book in Chinese. There were a variety of possible good reasons to go, but none justified a trip in and of itself. He said, There needs to be one decisive reason, and then the worthiness of the trip needs to be measured against that one reason. If I go, then we can backfill into the schedule all the other secondary activities. But if I go for a blended reason, Ill almost surely come back and feel like it was a waste of time.

His teachings on differentiation, value creation, and competition alone have helped me make some of the best investment decisions of my life such as Uber, Alibaba, and more. Back Story Peter is known as a master debater. When he appeared on my podcast, he answered questions submitted by my fans, which were upvoted on Facebook. Notice how often he reframes the question examines whether the question is the right question before answering. In several cases, how he dissects wording is as interesting as his answers. The tools in this profile are Peters thinking, and his macrolevel beliefs that guide thousands of smaller decisions. His answers are worth reading a few times each, asking yourself afterward, If I believed this, how would it affect my decisions in the next week? Over the next 6 to 12 months? What do you wish you had known about business 20 years ago? If you go back 20 or 25 years, I wish I would have known that there was no need to wait. I went to college. I went to law school. I worked in law and banking, though not for terribly long. But not until I started PayPal did I fully realize that you dont have to wait to start something. So if youre planning to do something with your life, if you have a 10year plan of how to get there, you should ask Why cant you do this in 6 months? Sometimes, you have to actually go through the complex, 10year trajectory. But its at least worth asking whether thats the story youre telling yourself, or whether thats the reality. How important is failure in business? I think failure is massively overrated. Most businesses fail for more than one reason. So when a business fails, you often dont learn anything at all because the failure was overdetermined. TF Overdetermined To determine, account for, or cause something in more than one way or with more conditions than are necessary. You will think it failed for Reason 1, but it failed for Reasons 1 through 5. And so the next business you start will fail for Reason 2, and then for 3 and so on. I think people actually do not learn very much from failure. I think it ends up being quite damaging and demoralizing to people in the long run, and my sense is that the death of every business is a tragedy. Its not some sort of beautiful aesthetic where theres a lot of carnage, but thats how progress happens, and its not some sort of educational imperative. So I think failure is neither a Darwinian nor an educational imperative. Failure is always simply a tragedy. What are the biggest tech trends that you see defining the future? I dont like talking in terms of tech trends because I think, once you have a trend, you have many people doing it. And once you have many people doing something, you have lots of competition and little differentiation. You, generally, never want to be part of a popular trend. You do not want to be the fourth online pet food company in the late 1990s. You do not want to be the twelfth thinpanel solar company in the last decade. And you dont want to be the nth company of any particular trend. So I think trends are often things to avoid. What I prefer over trends is a sense of mission. That you are working on a unique problem that people are not solving elsewhere. When Elon Musk started SpaceX, they set out the mission to go to Mars. You may agree or disagree with that as a mission statement, but it was a problem that was not going to be solved outside of SpaceX. All of the people working there knew that, and it motivated them tremendously. TF Peter has written elsewhere, The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin wont make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg wont create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you arent learning from them. How would you reply to someone who says that your position on college and higher education is hypocritical since you, yourself, went to Stanford for both undergraduate and law school? Context Many people see Peter as anticollege due to his Thiel Fellowship, which gives 100,000 to young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom. I think some people will always find objections of one sort or another. Had I not gone to Stanford or law school, people would object and say I had no idea what I was missing. So I think theyre likely to complain in any event. But I would say my view is not hypocritical because I have never made the claim that theres a one size fits all. So if I said that nobody should go to college, that might be hypocritical. But what I have said is that not everybody should do the same thing. There is something very odd about a society where the most talented people all get tracked toward'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

And the next Mark Zuckerberg wont create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you arent learning from them. How would you reply to someone who says that your position on college and higher education is hypocritical since you, yourself, went to Stanford for both undergraduate and law school? Context Many people see Peter as anticollege due to his Thiel Fellowship, which gives 100,000 to young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom. I think some people will always find objections of one sort or another. Had I not gone to Stanford or law school, people would object and say I had no idea what I was missing. So I think theyre likely to complain in any event. But I would say my view is not hypocritical because I have never made the claim that theres a one size fits all. So if I said that nobody should go to college, that might be hypocritical. But what I have said is that not everybody should do the same thing. There is something very odd about a society where the most talented people all get tracked toward the same elite colleges, where they end up studying the same small number of subjects and going into the same small number of careers. That strikes me as sort of a lack of diversity in our thinking about the kinds of things people should be doing. Its very limiting for our society as well as for those students. I certainly think I was very much guilty of this myself, if I look back on my Stanford undergraduate and law school years. Its possible I would do it again. But if I had to do something over, I would think about it much harder. I would ask questions. Why am I doing this? Am I doing this just because I have good grades and test scores and because I think its prestigious? Or am I doing this because Im extremely passionate about practicing law? I think there are good answers, and there are bad answers. And my retrospective on my early 20s is that I was way too focused on the wrong answers at the time. What do you think the future of education looks like? TF I include this mostly for the very first line and his reframe. I dont like the word education because it is such an extraordinary abstraction. Im very much in favor of learning. Im much more skeptical of credentialing or the abstraction called education. So there are all of these granular questions like What is it that were learning? Why are you learning it? Are you going to college because its a 4year party? Is it a consumption decision? Is it an investment decision where youre investing in your future? Is it insurance? Or is it a tournament where youre just beating other people? And are elite universities really like Studio 54 where its like an exclusive nightclub? I think if we move beyond the education bubble that were living in today, the future will be one in which people can speak about these things more clearly. Listen to his entire riff on this in episode 28 at 1724. What one thing would you most like to change about yourself or improve on? Its always hard to answer this, since it sort of begs the question of why I havent already improved on it. But I would say that when I look back on my younger self, I was insanely tracked, insanely competitive. And when youre very competitive, you get good at the thing youre competing with people on. But it comes at the expense of losing out on many other things. If youre a competitive chess player, you might get very good at chess but neglect to develop other things because youre focused on beating your competitors, rather than on doing something thats important or valuable. So Ive become, I think, much more selfaware over the years about the problematic nature of a lot of the competition. There have been rivalries that we get caught up in. And I would not pretend to have extricated myself from this altogether. So I think, every day, its something to reflect on and think about How do I become less competitive in order that I can become more successful? You studied philosophy as an undergraduate. What does philosophy have to do with business? And how has your study of philosophy helped you in your investing and career today? Im not sure how much the formal study of philosophy matters, but I think the fundamental philosophical question is one thats important for all of us, and its always this question of What do people agree merely by convention, and what is the truth? Theres a consensus of things that people believe to be true. Maybe the conventions are right, and maybe theyre not. And we never want to let a convention be a shortcut for truth. We always need to ask Is this true? And this is always what I get at with this indirect question Tell me something thats true that very few people agree with you on.

We cant outobedience the competition. TF I like this so much that I wanted to mention it twice. More context next time. Be a Meaningful Specific Instead of a Wandering Generality On saying no and declining things The phone rings, and lots of people want a thing. If it doesnt align with the thing that is your mission, and you say yes, now your mission is their mission. Theres nothing wrong with being a wandering generality instead of a meaningful specific, but dont expect to make the change you hope to make if thats what you do. Money is a story . . . and its better to tell a story about money youre happy with. Once you have enough for beans and rice and taking care of your family and a few other things, money is a story. You can tell yourself any story you want about money, and its better to tell yourself a story about money that you can happily live with. If You Generate Enough Bad Ideas, a Few Good Ones Tend to Show Up People who have trouble coming up with good ideas, if theyre telling you the truth, will tell you they dont have very many bad ideas. But people who have plenty of good ideas, if theyre telling you the truth, will say they have even more bad ideas. So the goal isnt to get good ideas the goal is to get bad ideas. Because once you get enough bad ideas, then some good ones have to show up. See James Altucher on page 246. What You Track Determines Your LensChoose Carefully Those of us who are lucky enough to live in a world where we have enough and we have a roof and we have foodwe find ourselves caught in this cycle of keeping track of the wrong things. Keeping track of how many times weve been rejected. Keeping track of how many times it didnt work. Keeping track of all the times someone has broken our heart or doublecrossed us or let us down. Of course, we can keep track of those things, but why? Why keep track of them? Are they making us better? Wouldnt it make more sense to keep track of the other stuff? To keep track of all the times it worked? All the times we took a risk? All the times we were able to brighten someone elses day? When we start doing that, we can redefine ourselves as people who are able to make an impact on the world. It took me a bunch of cycles to figure out that the narrative was up to me. If a narrative isnt working, well then, really, why are you using it? The narrative isnt done to you the narrative is something that you choose. Once we can dig deep and find a different narrative, then we ought to be able to change the game. Stories Let Us Lie to Ourselves and Those Lies Satisfy Our Desires TF The stories we tell ourselves can sometimes be selfdefeating.

Instead of seeking to change other people, they are willing to be changed. Part of the arc of what Im trying to teach is Everyone who can hear this has more power than they think they do. The question is, what are you going to do with that power? Can You Push Something Downhill? If you think about how hard it is to push a business uphill, particularly when youre just getting started, one answer is to say Why dont you just start a different business, a business you can push downhill? My friend Lynn Gordon is a brilliant thinker and designer, and for years, she was in the business of designing toys and soft goods for moms with toddlers. Every toy company in America was mean to her, rejected her, had nothing to do with her. I said Lynn, its simple. Toy companies dont like toy designers. Theyre not organized to do business with toy designers. Theyre not hoping toy designers will come to them. I said, Come with me into the book business. Because every day, there are underpaid, really smart people in the book business who wake up waiting for the next idea to come across their desk. Theyre eager to buy what you have to sell. And within two months, she did the 52 activity decks and ultimately sold more than 5 million decks of cards. First, Ten People Seth has published roughly 6,500 posts on his blog since 2002. Which blog post would he point people to first, if he had to pick one? The blog post I point people to the most is called First, Ten, and it is a simple theory of marketing that says tell ten people, show ten people, share it with ten people ten people who already trust you and already like you. If they dont tell anybody else, its not that good and you should start over. If they do tell other people, youre on your way. To Create Something Great Or Eventually Huge, Start Extremely Small My suggestion is, whenever possible, ask yourself Whats the smallest possible footprint I can get away with? What is the smallest possible project that is worth my time? What is the smallest group of people who I could make a difference for, or to? Because smallest is achievable. Smallest feels risky. Because if you pick smallest and you fail, now youve really screwed up. We want to pick big. Infinity is our friend. Infinity is safe. Infinity gives us a place to hide. So, I want to encourage people instead to look for the small. To be on one medium in a place where people can find you. To have one sort of interaction with one tribe, with one group where you dont have a lot of lifeboats. See 1,000 True Fans on page 289. No One Gets a Suzuki Tattoo. You Can Decide That You Want to Be TattooWorthy. Seth on Suzuki versus HarleyDavidson, the latter of which has deliberately created an aspirational brand. I Quantify Almost Nothing in My Life I sometimes fear Ill lose my edge if I stop measuring everything. This line was freeing for me to hear, as Seth has been an idol of sorts for years. He inspired me to start cycling off of quantification, much like I cycle off of supplements for at least 1 week every 2 months example I took July 2016 off of tracking weightbody fat, social media, website, and newsletter stats. I like to study what Seth doesnt do as much as what he does. Seth has no comments on his blog, he doesnt pay attention to analytics, and he doesnt use Twitter or Facebook except to rebroadcast his daily blog posts, which is automated. In a world of tool obsession and FOMO fear of missing out on the next social platform, Seth doesnt appear to care. He simply focuses on putting out good and short daily posts, he ignores the rest, and he continues to thrive. There are no real rules, so make rules that work for you. Quick Takes Breakfast Breakfast is one more decision I dont make, so its a frozen banana, hemp powder, almond milk, a dried plum, and some walnuts in the blender. Cooking Lessons My wife got me a Chris Schlesinger cooking class, and it was the only cooking class Id ever taken. In 20 minutes, I learned more about cooking than I think Ive learned before or since. Because Chris basically taught me how to think about what you were trying to do and basically said, A You should taste the food as you go, which a surprisingly small number of people do and B salt and olive oil actually are cheating and theyre secret weapons and they always work. Audiogon Seth is an audiophile. He particularly enjoys focusing on analog and, in many ways, anachronistic equipment still made by hand.

Quick Takes Breakfast Breakfast is one more decision I dont make, so its a frozen banana, hemp powder, almond milk, a dried plum, and some walnuts in the blender. Cooking Lessons My wife got me a Chris Schlesinger cooking class, and it was the only cooking class Id ever taken. In 20 minutes, I learned more about cooking than I think Ive learned before or since. Because Chris basically taught me how to think about what you were trying to do and basically said, A You should taste the food as you go, which a surprisingly small number of people do and B salt and olive oil actually are cheating and theyre secret weapons and they always work. Audiogon Seth is an audiophile. He particularly enjoys focusing on analog and, in many ways, anachronistic equipment still made by hand. Audiogon is a website where you can find people who buy things new and sell them 6 months later in perfect condition. Parenting Advice What could possibly be more important than your kid? Please dont play the busy card. If you spend 2 hours a day without an electronic device, looking your kid in the eye, talking to them and solving interesting problems, you will raise a different kid than someone who doesnt do that. Thats one of the reasons why I cook dinner every night. Because what a wonderful, semidistracted environment in which the kid can tell you the truth. For you to have lowstakes but superimportant conversations with someone whos important to you. On Education and Teaching Kids Sooner or later, parents have to take responsibility for putting their kids into a system that is indebting them and teaching them to be cogs in an economy that doesnt want cogs anymore. Parents get to decide . . . and from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m., those kids are getting homeschooled. And theyre either getting homeschooled and watching The Flintstones, or theyre getting homeschooled and learning something useful. I think we need to teach kids two things 1 how to lead, and 2 how to solve interesting problems. Because the fact is, there are plenty of countries on Earth where there are people who are willing to be obedient and work harder for less money than us. So we cannot outobedience the competition. Therefore, we have to outlead or outsolve the other people. . . . The way you teach your kids to solve interesting problems is to give them interesting problems to solve. And then, dont criticize them when they fail. Because kids arent stupid. If they get in trouble every time they try to solve an interesting problem, theyll just go back to getting an A by memorizing whats in the textbook. I spend an enormous amount of time with kids . . . I think that its a privilege to be able to look a trusting, energetic, smart 11yearold in the eye and tell him the truth. And what we can say to that 11yearold is I really dont care how you did on your vocabulary test. I care about whether you have something to say. Whats something you believe that other people think is crazy? Deep down, I am certain that people are plastic in the positive sense flexible and able to grow. I think almost everything is made, not born, and that makes people uncomfortable because it puts them on the hook, but I truly believe it. Seths favorite audiobooks, which he listens to repeatedly TF First Ill provide the list, then his recommended uses. Goals Setting and Achieving Them on Schedule, How to Stay Motivated, and Secrets of Closing the Sale by Zig Ziglar Zig is your grandfather and my grandfather. Hes Tony Robbinss grandfather. None of us would be here if it werent for Zig. Works of Pema Chdrn Almost the flip side. Im so much better at protracted difficult periods because of Pema and because of meditation and because of knowing how to sit with it and not insist that the tension go away. Leap First Inspired by Zig and Pema, and some work I did, I did this book for charity its a short audiobook and you can get it at Sounds True. The Art of Possibility by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander . . . . which is very hard to find on audio and is totally worth seeking out. The War of Art by Steven Pressfield Also hard to find on audio. I find Steves voice to be fascinating, and even before I knew him, I was fascinated by listening to him speak his own work. The War of Art is one of those books, at least for me when I finally was exposed to it, I said, Why wasnt I informed? Why did it take this long for this book to land on my desk? . . . You need to be clear with yourself about what you are afraid of, why you are afraid, and whether you care enough to dance with that fear because it will never go away. Just Kids by Patti Smith This is the single best audiobook ever recorded by Patti Smith. It is not going to change the way you do business, but it might change the way you live. Its about love and loss and art. Debt by David Graeber I recommend it in audio because David is sometimes repetitive and a little elliptical but in audio its all okay because you can just listen to it again.

If you need to see a path that is more colored than the one youre already on, which is pretty Technicolor, then its Zig. And if you just want to cry a little, its Just Kids, and then Debt is the one that is closest to reading a book. I dont think many people should listen to Debt ten times. Seths best purchase of 100 or less? You could become obsessed with artisanal beantobar chocolate. Not that one should, but one could. So I did, and I worked my way up the ladder. About a year ago, I was going to start my own chocolate company because its not that hard. Then I bumped into a few brands that were doing it better than I ever could. . . . There are two chocolate companies I want to highlight Rogue from western Massachusetts and Askinosie. And Im actually an advisor to a new acumen company called Cacao Hunters in Colombia. What advice would you give your 30yearold self? I had so many bumps starting when I was 30 years old. They lasted for 9 years, and I wouldnt tell my 30yearold self anything. Because if I hadnt had those bumps, I wouldnt be me, and Im glad Im me. Pet ObsessionsCoffee and Vodka Seth doesnt drink coffee or alcohol. Nonetheless, he enjoys making elaborate espresso and vodka for his family and guests. Odd side obsessions are a common trait of nearly everyone in this book, and I find Seths description hilarious. His vodka recipe is also simply delicious The coffee thing, well start there. I dont drink coffee. I wish I did. I need a vice. But I like making it. I likewithout being one of those people who is measuring everything, because thats not my shtickto have an intuitive sense of what makes a good pull of espresso. I used to have a fancy Slayer machine, which is this super digital hunk of a device that did not belong in anyones kitchen, particularly mine. So when it started acting up, I was able to sell it for a fair price and switched, in the completely opposite direction, to a Swissmade, 17yearold, totally manual machine. Youve got to pull a handle. And I roast my own beans, which is key. Marco Arment cofounder of Tumblr, creator of Instapaper and Overcast taught me that. Roasting your own beans is more important than any other thing you can do, if you want to make coffee. I think theres a metaphor there. I know theres a metaphor there. Which is, you can spend a lot of time trying to fix stuff later but starting with the right raw materials makes a huge difference. TIM Then, vodka . . . SETH Theres a place near my house called Blue Hill at Stone Barns Center, which used to be the Rockefellers summer house. Its a nice restaurant. At the barI dont drink either, but Im told that at the barthey serve honey oatmeal vodka. I reverse engineered the recipe, and its not a still, but I make it in my basement. The recipe, for those who are interested, is you take a bottle of vodkayou dont want the supercheap stuff but you dont want the expensive stuff because thats a little bit of a ripoffyou pour it over a pound of just plain old oatmeal, uncooked, and half a jar of honey. You let it sit in the fridge for 2 weeks, stirring it now and then. Then you strain it back into the original bottle and youre done. Final words of advice? Send someone a thankyou note tomorrow. We all have, lets say, two or three dozen massive pain points in our lives that everyone can relate to. I try to basically write about those, and then I try to write about how I attempted to recover from them.

This is refreshing in a world of rahrah positivethinking gurus who are all forced smiles and highfives. Some of my most popular blog posts since 2007 have been the least timeconsuming but the most uncomfortable. To produce these, I usually ask myself What am I embarrassed to be struggling with? And what am I doing about it? If You Cant Generate 10 Ideas, Generate 20 James recommends the habit of writing down 10 ideas each morning in a waiters pad or tiny notebook. This exercise is for developing your idea muscle and confidence for creativity on demand, so regular practice is more important than the topics What if you just cant come up with 10 ideas? Heres the magic trick If you cant come up with 10 ideas, come up with 20 ideas. . . . You are putting too much pressure on yourself. Perfectionism is the ENEMY of the idea muscle . . . its your brain trying to protect you from harm, from coming up with an idea that is embarrassing and stupid and could cause you to suffer pain. The way you shut this off is by forcing the brain to come up with bad ideas. So lets say youve written down 5 ideas for books and they are all pretty good. And now you are stuck. . . . Well, lets come up with some bad ideas. Heres one Dorothy and the Wizard of Wall Street. Dorothy is in a hurricane in Kansas and she lands right at the corner of Broadway and Wall Street in New York City and she has to make her way all the way down Wall Street to find The Wizard of Wall Street Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs in order to get home to Kansas. Instead, he offers her a job to be a highfrequency trader. What a bad idea! OK, now go on to the next 15 ideas. I then divide my paper into two columns. On one column is the list of ideas. On the other column is the list of FIRST STEPS. Remember, only the first step. Because you have no idea where that first step will take you. One of my favorite examples Richard Branson didnt like the service on airlines he was flying, so he had an idea Im going to start a new airline. How the heck can a magazine publisher start an airline from scratch with no money? His first step He called Boeing to see if they had an airplane he could lease. No idea is so big that you cant take the first step. If the first step seems too hard, make it simpler. And dont worry again if the idea is bad. This is all practice. TF If you cant get 10 good ideas, get 20 ideas. This mantra has proven very valuable. About a year ago, I brainstormed a list of The craziest things I could do while sitting at a Wired conference listening to outofthebox thinkers like iconic photographer Platon. After a few bullets e.g., Give away all my money, Sell all my belongings, Go offline completely for 6 months, I got stuck. So, in true James fashion, I decided to drop my standards and go nuts. Things got deep into bad idea territory quickly, even including Cut off both feet WTF?. But the list grew and grew, and one of them was Take an indefinite startup vacation, which ended up being one of the most important ideas of the last 5 years of my life see page 384 for more. Sample Lists for Jamess Daily 10 Practice Not all of Jamess idea lists are businessrelated. In fact, few are. He elaborates Its hard to come up with more than 3,000 business ideas a year. Im lucky if I come up with a few business ideas. The key is to have fun with it, or else you dont do it. In his words, but condensed for space, here are some examples of the types of lists James makes 10 old ideas I can make new 10 ridiculous things I would invent e.g., the smart toilet 10 books I can write The Choose Yourself Guide to an Alternative Education, etc. 10 business ideas for GoogleAmazonTwitteretc. 10 people I can send ideas to 10 podcast ideas or videos I can shoot e.g., Lunch with James, a video podcast where I just have lunch with people over Skype and we chat 10 industries where I can remove the middleman 10 things I disagree with that everyone else assumes is religion college, home ownership, voting, doctors, etc. 10 ways to take old posts of mine and make books out of them 10 people I want to be friends with then figure out the first step to contact them 10 things I learned yesterday 10 things I can do differently'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

Beginnings Ah, Stanford Graduate School of Business GSB. Stanford, with its palm treelined avenues and red terra cotta roofing, always held a unique place in my mind. But my fantasies of attending GSB reached a fever pitch when I sat in on a class called Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital taught by Peter Wendell, who had led earlystage investments in companies such as Intuit. Within 30 minutes, Pete had taught me more about the real world of venture capital inside baseball than all of the books Id read on the subject. I was ecstatic and ready to apply to GSB. Who wouldnt be? So I enthusiastically began a process I would repeat twice downloading the application to get started, taking the full campus tour, and sitting in on other classes. It was the other classes that got my knickers in a twist. Some were incredible, taught by allstars whod done it all, but many, many others were taught by PhD theoreticians who used big words and lots of PowerPoint slides. One teacher spent 45 minutes on slide after slide of equations that could be summed up with, If you build a crappy product, people wont buy it. No one needed to prove that to me, let alone drown me in calculus to do so. At the end of that class, I turned to my student guide for the tour and asked him how it compared to other classes. He answered Oh, this is easily my favorite. That was the death of business school for me.

Compared to traditional VC, angel investing involves putting relatively small amounts of moneyoften from 10K to 50Kinto earlystage startups. In Mikes world, earlystage could mean two engineers with a prototype for a website, or it could mean a successful serial entrepreneur with a new idea. The angels usually have relevant business experience and are considered smart money. In other words, their advice and introductions are just as valuable as the money they put in. After several lunches with Mike, Id found my business school. I decided to make a 2year Tim Ferriss Fund that would replace Stanford business school. I wouldnt go through the formal steps to create a legally viable fund I would simply set a plan and invest my own capital as if I had such a fund. Stanford GSB isnt cheap. I rounded it down to 60K per year in 2007, for a total of 120K over 2 years. For the Tim Ferriss Fund, I would aim to intelligently spend 120K over 2 years on angel investing in 10K to 20K chunks, meaning 6 to 12 companies in total. The goal of this business school would be to learn as much as possible about startup finance, deal structuring, rapid product design, acquisition conversations, etc., as possible. But curriculum was just part of business school. The other part was getting to know the students, preferably the most astute movers and shakers in the startup investing world. Business school curriculum network. The most important characteristic of my personal MBA I planned on losing 120K. I went into the Tim Ferriss Fund viewing the 120K as a sunk tuition cost, but expecting that the lessons learned and people met would be worth that 120K investment over time. The 2year plan was to methodically spend 120K for the learning experience, not for the ROI. Please note that I would not suggest mimicking this approach with angel investing, unless You have a clear informational advantage insider access that gives you a competitive edge. I live in the nexus of Silicon Valley and know many top CEOs and investors, so I have better sources of information than the vast majority of the world. I rarely invest in public companies precisely because I know that professionals have more tools and leverage than I do. You are 100 comfortable losing your MBA funds. You should only gamble with what youre very comfortable losing. If the prospective financial loss drives you to even mild desperation or depression, you shouldnt do it. You have started andor managed successful businesses in the past. You limit angel investment funds to 10 to 15 or less of your liquid assets. I subscribe to the Nassim Taleb barbell school of investment, which I implement as 90 in conservative asset classes like cashlike equivalents and the remaining 10 in speculative investments that can capitalize on positive black swans. Even if the above criteria are met, people overestimate their risk tolerance. Even if you have only 100 to invest, this is important to explore. In 2007, I had one wealth manager ask me, What is your risk tolerance? and I answered honestly I have no idea. It threw him off. I then asked him for the average of his clients responses. He said, Most answer that they would not panic up to about 20 down in one quarter. My followup question was When do most actually panic and start selling low? His answer When theyre down 5 in one quarter. Unless youve lost 20 in a quarter, its practically impossible to predict your response. Also, you might be fine losing 20 out of 100 but freak out when youre down 20K out of 100K. The absolute number can matter as much as the percentage. As Cus DAmato, Mike Tysons legendary first trainer, famously said Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. To wouldbe angel investors, I suggest the following Go to a casino or racetrack and dont leave until youve spent 20 of a typical investment and watched it disappear. Lets say youre planning on making 25K worth of investments. Id ask you to then purposefully lose 5K over the course of at least 3 hours, and certainly not all at once. Its important that you slowly bleed losses as you attempt to learn the game, to exert some control over something you cant control. If you can remain unaffected after slowly losing your 5K or 20 of your planned typical investment, consider making your first angel investment. But proceed with caution. Even among brilliant people in the startup world, there is an expression If you want to make a small fortune, start with a large fortune and angel invest.

The First Deal and First Lesson So what did I do? I immediately went out and broke my own rules like a dummy. There was a very promising startup that, based on using Alexa ranking correlations to valuations beware of this approach, was more than 5 times undervalued! Even if it hit a base hit like a 25 million exit, I could easily recoup my planned 120K! I got very excited and cut a check for 50K. Thats a bit aggressive for a first deal, dont you think? Mike asked me over coffee. Not a chance. My intuition was loud and clear. I was convinced, based on other investors and all of the excitement surrounding the deal, that this company was on the cusp of exploding. This startup was on life support within 2 years and dead shortly thereafter, so I lost that 50K. Oops. Following the Rules Lesson 1 If youve formulated intelligent rules, follow your own fcking rules. Below are a few that subsequently worked well for me. Note that I dont need to satisfy all of them, but I do want to satisfy most of them If it has a single founder, the founder must be technical. Two technical cofounders are ideal. I must be eager to use the product myself. This rules out many great companies, but I want a verified market I understand. Related to the previous point consumerfacing productservice e.g., Uber, Twitter, Facebook, etc. or smallbusiness focused productservice e.g., Shopify, not big enterprise software. These are companies whose valuations I can directly impact through my platform, promotion to my audience, introductions to journalists, etc. More than 100K active users OR serial founders with past exits OR more than 10K paying customers. Whenever possible, I want to pour gasoline on the fire, not start the fire. More than 10 monthonmonth activity growth. Clean cap table, minimal previous financing or none, no bridge rounds. U.S.based companies or companies willing to create U.S.based investable entities. Shopify started in Canada, for instance. Have the founders ever had crappy service jobs, like waiting tables or bussing at restaurants? If so, they tend to stay grounded for longer. Less entitlement and megalomania usually means better decisions and better drinking company, as this stuff normally takes quite a few years. By the end of 2010, following these rules, I was fortunate to have had two successful exits. The first, Daily Burn, was acquired by IAC. This guaranteed that I would not lose money on my 2year fund, assuming I didnt piss the proceeds away. Relevant side note on Daily Burn They checked the boxes on my checklist, but the majority of the investors but not all I asked to participate declined because the cofounders lived in Alabama and Colorado instead of a tech hub. Mike Maples explained a simple rule of thumb to me at the time, and Ive applied it to many deals since Breaking your rules to coinvest with wellknown investors is usually a bad idea, but following your rules when others reject a startup can work out extremely well. The second exit might seem odd. Remember that learning was my main reason for doing the realworld MBA in the first place. My second exit was my own company! Using what I learned through angel investing about deal structures and the acquisition process, I became less intimidated by the idea of selling a company. It need not be complicated, as I learned, and BrainQUICKEN was sold in late 2009. This means the ROI on my personal MBA was, based on those two alone, well over twice my tuition. Now, that might seem like a paltry sum to some people 120K200K for two years of effort?, but its important to note two things Selling my company completely freed up my time to focus on other things, such as The 4Hour Body, which hit 1 on the New York Times bestseller list and created thousands of opportunities.

This is why the fund life of most venture capital funds is 10 years. That is how long it takes most big successes to reach IPO or get acquired. In other words, you might not know if youre good or bad at angel investing, right or wrong in your bets, for a LONG time. So, what are some of the other bets I made between 2007 and 2009? Some of them ended up being laterstage than Seed or Series A, as I began getting invited to such deals Shopify IPOadvisor Uber TBD but looking to be my biggest of all Facebook IPO Twitter IPO Alibaba at 9share IPO As I write this in 2016, Ive had 6 to 10 additional successful exits, and Ive also been able to sell some private stock on the secondary market. When startups raise new rounds of financing, this is sometimes offered to existing shareholders. Its worth mentioning that I had to adjust my investment approach from 2008 to 2010 due to my 50K slipup and the selfimposed limit of 120K of starting capital. I adopted the additional rules below, whichwhile seemingly arbitraryhelped me to filter out 90 of deals and not lose money. I used these until roughly 2010, at which point I had more capital and A preferred to invest cash instead of time easier to scale, and B could use slightly different rules, as I had a bigger safety net. Even if you have no interest in the startup game, you should have an interest in formally deciding on rules that make damaging, bad decisions hard. Here are a few that helped me. If each startup exits at 5 times its current Series A valuation, it should be able to cover twothirds of your fund capital. Most of your startups will fail, so the successes need to make up for losses. Lets say theres a startup thats offered you 15K worth of investment, and theyre going to have a 1.5 million postmoney valuation after the round of financing. If were using the twothirds rule, and your fund like mine from 2007 to 2009 is 120K, you shouldnt invest 15K in this startup, as 15K x 5 75K. Twothirds of 120K is 80K, so youd either have to invest slightly more, lower the valuation, or add in advising expanded upon below and get more equity in return. This isnt even accounting for dilution, which is beyond the scope of this book but likely in most cases. If a startup exits at 3 times its current valuation, it should allow you to walk away with 300k. This was one of my preferred methods for qualifying or disqualifying a startup. As much as I might love someone, I cant take another parttime job for 7 to 10 years for a 50K payoff. Lets say a startup ends up with a 3 million postmoney valuation. If I help them more than triple the value of their company to 10 million, how much do I walk away with if there are no more rounds of funding? If it works out to 50K, it isnt worth it for me. If, considering the time invested, I could earn 5 times that doing other things, it makes no sense to do the deal. Move from Investor InvestorAdvisor Advisor Lets assume you have committed to spending 60K per year on angel investments, just as I did without really knowing what I was signing up for. This means two things You arent going to be able to satisfy the previous rules of covering twothirds of the fund or making 300K at 3x for many companies. Perhaps youll make 3 to 6 investments. 3 to 6 investments generally doesnt work in angel investing, where most pros assume that 9 out of 10 will fail. Its therefore nearly impossible for you to get a good statistical spread with 60K per year. The math just doesnt work. The math especially doesnt work if you screw it up like I did by getting overexcited and dropping 50K on your first investment. Heres how I did a course correction and dealt with this problem First, I invested very small amounts in a few select startups, ideally those in closeknit seed accelerator formerly called incubator networks like Y Combinator and Techstars. Then, I did my best to deliver above and beyond the value of my investment. In other words, I wanted the founders to ask themselves, Why the hell is this guy helping us so much for a ridiculously small amount of equity? This was critical for establishing a reputation as a major valueadd, someone who helped a lot for very little. Second, leaning on this burgeoning reputation, I began negotiating blended agreements with startups involving some investment, but additional advisory equity as a requirement. Advising equity is equity that I get over time say, of the total each month for 2 years but dont have to pay for. The startup can cancel at any time if Im not performing. Third and last, I made the jump to pure advising. After the end of the first year of the Tim Ferriss Fund, more than 70 of my startup investments were made with time rather than cash. In the last 6 months of the fund, I wrote only one check for a startup. Moving gradually from pure investing to pure advising allowed me to reduce the total amount of capital invested, increase equity percentages, and make the 120K work, despite my early mistakes. This approach also, I believe, produced better results for the startups. Ultimately, startups became my golden goose, and when CB Insights analyzed the top 1,000 angel investors in 2014, they placed me in sixth place. The irony is that Ive now stopped angel investing completely, even'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

He is the bestselling author of How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, Gods Debris, and The Dilbert Principle.

Naval Ravikant page 546 regularly credits Scotts short blog post The Day You Became a Better Writer for improving his writing. LesserKnown Cartoons He Reads and Enjoys F Minus Pearls Before Swine The Six Elements of Humor Scott believes there are six elements of humor naughty, clever, cute, bizarre, mean, and recognizable. You have to have at least two dimensions to succeed. Let me give you an example. Cute is usually kids and dogs, and bizarre is just anything thats out of place. If you know your cartoon history, you will know that The Far Side used primarily the dimension of putting something out of place. So youd have an animal talking. As soon as the animals talking, hes got one dimension. Hes basically starting a race, and hes already ahead of you if youre the cartoonist whos sitting there saying, I think Ill do a comic about anything, the world is my canvas. Hes got the bizarre, and then hell have the animal say something, often in the framing or the type of mood that a human would. Thats the recognizable part. Take a look at the best comic strip of all time, that I think nearly everyone in the world would say, Calvin and Hobbes. Theres a talking tiger that is both bizarre and cute. So he took The Far Side one dimension further as a starting point. The moment you start reading Calvin and Hobbes, you already have cute because his drawing is amazing. Hes got double cute. Hes got a child and an animal, and its a cool animal. So he starts that, before he even writes a joke. So then, if he has the kid doing something naughtyalso, anything bad happening to anybody meanthats of course one of the dimensions. . . .

SCOTT No, I wisely decided that was not a good commercial decision, at least not for newspapers because theyre all aggressively rated G. Systems Versus Goals Scott helped me refocus, to use his language, on systems instead of goals. This involves choosing projects and habits that, even if they result in failures in the eyes of the outside world, give you transferable skills or relationships. In other words, you choose options that allow you to inevitably succeed over time, as you build assets that carry over to subsequent projects. Fundamentally, systems could be thought of as asking yourself, What persistent skills or relationships can I develop? versus What shortterm goal can I achieve? The former has a potent snowball effect, while the latter is a binary passfail with no consolation prize. Scott writes about this extensively in his book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big Kind of the Story of My Life. Heres one realworld example When I first started blogging, my future wife often asked about what my goal was. The blogging seemed to double my workload while promising a 5 higher income that didnt make any real difference in my life. It seemed a silly use of time. I tried explaining that blogging was a system, not a goal. But I never did a good job of it. Ill try again here. Writing is a skill that requires practice. So the first part of my system involves practicing on a regular basis. I didnt know what I was practicing for, exactly, and thats what makes it a system and not a goal. I was moving from a place with low odds being an outofpractice writer to a place of good odds a wellpracticed writer with higher visibility. The second part of my blogging system is a sort of RD for writing. I write on a variety of topics and see which ones get the best response. I also write in different voices. I have my humorously selfdeprecating voice, my angry voice, my thoughtful voice, my analytical voice, my halfcrazy voice, my offensive voice, and so on. Readers do a good job of telling me what works and what doesnt. When the Wall Street Journal took notice of my blog posts, they asked me to write some guest features. Thanks to all of my writing practice, and my knowledge of which topics got the best response, the guest articles were highly popular. Those articles werent big moneymakers either, but it all fit within my system of public practice. My writing for the Wall Street Journal, along with my public practice on the blog, attracted the attention of book publishers, and that attention turned into a book deal. And the book deal generated speaking requests that are embarrassingly lucrative. So the payday for blogging eventually arrived, but I didnt know in advance what path it would take. My blogging has kicked up dozens of business opportunities over the past years, so it could have taken any direction. TF My podcast was never intended to be a business. I was burned out after The 4Hour Chef, which was nearly 700 pages, and I wanted a casual but creative break from big projects. Since I enjoyed being interviewed by Joe Rogan, Marc Maron, Nerdist, and other podcasting heavies, I decided to try longform audio for six episodes. If I didnt enjoy it after six, I would throw in the towel and walk. My rationale Worstcase scenario, the experience would help me improve my interviewing, force me to refine my questions, and eliminate verbal tics, all of which would help later projects. One or two episodes wouldnt give me sufficient practice for a hockey stick in the learning curve, so I somewhat arbitrarily chose six episodes as a test run. Roughly 200 episodes later, here we are. On the Odd Effectiveness of Affirmations I believe the devil is in the details with this bullet, so its longer than normal. Its one of those things that shouldnt work but nevertheless appears to improve the odds. I tested Scotts approach in my own life after a live Tony Robbins event, which I detail more on page 449. For now, here is Scotts origin story Let me say first that I dont believe that if you say your affirmations, something magic will happen, and the universe will change in some nonscientific way. . . . What I have said is that Ive used the technique, and I got a certain experience, which Ill be happy to share, and then I tell the story. . . . Im in my 20s.

For now, here is Scotts origin story Let me say first that I dont believe that if you say your affirmations, something magic will happen, and the universe will change in some nonscientific way. . . . What I have said is that Ive used the technique, and I got a certain experience, which Ill be happy to share, and then I tell the story. . . . Im in my 20s. I was taking a course in hypnosis to learn how to become a professional hypnotist and get certified. One day this woman in my class said, Youve got to try this thing called affirmations. I read about it in a book, but I dont remember the name of the book. So I cant tell you here, because she didnt tell me. And she said, It works like this. All you do is you pick a goal and you write it down 15 times a day in some specific sentence form, like I, Scott Adams, will become an astronaut, for example. And you do that every day. Then it will seem as if the universe just starts spitting up opportunities. It will look to you like these are coincidences, and whether they are or not is less relevant than the fact that they seem to pop up. So I, being my rational self, am saying That seems like a terrible waste of time. Theres no science behind that, blah, blah, blah. She convinced me, partly because she was a member of Mensa, that she wasnt dumb. The two affirmations that are notable were First, I said I would become a numberone bestselling author. This was before Id ever written a book, and Id never taken a class in writing, except a 2day course in business writing, and that was it. The Dilbert Principle became the numberone bestselling book. There was a period . . . where I lost my voice beginning in 2005 due to to spasmodic dysphonia. I couldnt speak for three and a half years. . . . That was the next time I used affirmations. And the affirmation was I, Scott Adams, will speak perfectly. Now, I realize I dont speak perfectly, but when we get to that story youll see that theres more to it. TIM How exactly are you practicing these affirmations? SCOTT Ill tell you exactly how I did it, but then Ill also tell you that Im positive the exact method doesnt matter. I think what matters is the degree of focus and the commitment you have to that focus. Because the last affirmation I mentioned was primarily done in my head while driving, but continuously for years, about 3 years. At first, the way I did it back in those times was I used a pencil or a pen and a piece of paper, and I wrote the same sentence 15 times, once a day, I think. Heres why I think it seems to work, and there are several possibilities. One is something I learned long ago, and I forget who coined it but have you ever heard the phrase reticular activation? Its basically the idea that its easy to hear your own name spoken in a crowd. Youll hear background noise blah, blah, blah, Tim Ferriss, blah, blah, blah. And you think, how did I hear that one thing in this whole bunch of crowd noise? Basically, your brain isnt capable of processing everything in its environment, or even coming close. So the best it can do is set up these little filters. And the way it sets its filters is by what you pay attention to. Its what you spend the most energy on. . . . Thats how you set your filter. So your filter is automatically set for your name, because thats the thing that matters most to you. But you can use these affirmations, presumablythis is just a hypothesisto focus your mind and your memory on a very specific thing. And that would allow you to notice things in your environment that might have already been there. Its just that your filter was set to ignore, and then you just tune it through this memory and repetition trick until it widens a little bit to allow some extra stuff in. Now, there is some science to back that. . . . Eventually I decided to start the affirmation, I, Scott Adams would become a famous cartoonist. The odds of becoming a famous cartoonistI think about 2,000 people submit packages to the big syndicates, the people who give you the big contract, your big break. They might pick a half dozen. Of those half dozen, most of them will not make it after a year or two, so its very rare. In fact, Dilbert was probably the biggest breakout, or one of the biggest, in 20 years. Predicting TrumpWhat You Can Learn On September 22, 2015, Scott Adams correctly predicted on my podcast that 10 months later, Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee. At the time, this was considered laughable. Scott based this on what he considered Trumps hypnosis abilities and media savvy, not his policies.

At the time, this was considered laughable. Scott based this on what he considered Trumps hypnosis abilities and media savvy, not his policies. This might seem like old news, but there are actionable lessons in what Scott noticed Take the debate where he Trump came in as the underprepared buffoon who was going to blow himself up. And Megyn Kelly of Fox News decided that, yes, thats exactly what was going to happen, and she started right out with the Did you say all these bad things about women? quote. Now, every other politician would have been smeared off the stage by that, because it wouldnt matter what he said back. . . . The logical answer, maybe somebody wouldve said, Oh, that was taken out of context, or whatever, which is what people usually say, and it usually is. But the public isnt going to hear that. Theyre just going to hear the feeling that they felt when Megyn Kelly said that persons name plus bad to women. Thats really the beginning and the end of the thinking for, lets say, at least 20 of the public about the same 20 that can easily be hypnotized, coincidentally. But what did Trump do? As soon as that question came up, he semiinterrupted her and he said, Only Rosie ODonnell. That, my friend, is hypnosis. He took an anchor that everybody could visualize, and his core audience already had a negative impression. Their negative impression of Rosie ODonnell almost certainly was bigger, stronger, more visual and more important than whatever Megyn Kelly just said. . . . She showed him four kings and he beat her hand, and he did it without even trying, and he did it with a method which is well understood. Its a negotiating technique. You throw down an anchor, you divert everybody. Instead of becoming this sexist, which he could have been on day one, he became the straight talker. Now, I know you follow the headlines so you know what happened next. Roger Ailes of Fox News weighed in to say, We need to make peace with Donald Trump because this is getting out of hand, and Donald Trump made peace with him. How do you interpret that? Ill tell you how I interpret it. I interpret it as Donald Trump just bought Fox News without paying a freaking penny. Because if they want him to appear on their show, thats up to him, and he proved he doesnt need them. TF At this point, I asked Scott about a clever line Trump often uses to shut down journalists, which is a quick interjection of Check your facts, insert journalist name. SCOTT Check your facts is what I call the high ground maneuver. Its the same thing Jobs did when he explained away Antennagate just by saying, All smart phones have problems. Were trying to make our customers happy. He made a national story go away in less than 30 seconds with those two sentences. Morning FloodingListening to the Body Instead of the Mind To minimize decisions, Scott wakes up, pushes a button for coffee, and has the same breakfast every morning a chocolatepeanut butter flavor Clif Builders 20gram protein bar. The next step is exposing himself to new information to generate ideas for his comic strip Theres a process where once you clear your mind, you have to flood it. You may use different words for this, but I know you do it. So you empty it, and then you flood it with new input thats not the old input. So Im looking at the news, Im looking at stuff I havent seen. Im not looking at yesterdays problem for the fifth time. Im looking at a new problem, Im thinking of a new idea. But then youve got to find out where in that flood is the little piece thats worth working with. Thats where I use the body model. I kind of cycle through all this stuff. The model is Your brain cant find good contact, not directly in an intellectual sense. Obviously, the brains involved, but what I mean is that as Im thinking of these ideas and theyre flowing through my head, Im monitoring my body Im not monitoring my mind. And when my body changes, I have something that other people are going to care about, too. TF B.J. Novak page 378 has expressed something very similar. This bodily reactionan involuntary halfchuckle, a rush of adrenaline, a surge of endorphins, a sharp change of emotions, etc.can act as a metal detector for good material. It takes practice, but it works. On Diversification for Stress Management The below came from me asking, What advice would you give your 30yearold self?

Diversification works in almost every area of your life to reduce your stress. Dilbert HardwareWhat Scott Draws On Wacom Cintiq tablet The Logic of the Double or Triple Threat On career advice, Scott has written the following, which is slightly trimmed for space here. This is effectively my mantra, and youll see why I bring it up If you want an average, successful life, it doesnt take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths 1 Become the best at one specific thing. 2 Become very good top 25 at two or more things. The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I dont recommend anyone even try. The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25 with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but Im hardly an artist. And Im not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but Im funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. Its the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it. I always advise young people to become good public speakers top 25. Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly youre the boss of the people who have only one skill. Or get a degree in business on top of your engineering degree, law degree, medical degree, science degree, or whatever. Suddenly youre in charge, or maybe youre starting your own company using your combined knowledge. Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable. You make yourself rare by combining two or more pretty goods until no one else has your mix. . . . At least one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication, either written or verbal. And it could be as simple as learning how to sell more effectively than 75 of the world. Thats one. Now add to that whatever your passion is, and you have two, because thats the thing youll easily put enough energy into to reach the top 25. If you have an aptitude for a third skill, perhaps business or public speaking, develop that too. It sounds like generic advice, but youd be hardpressed to find any successful person who didnt have about three skills in the top 25. TF Marc Andreessen page 170 long ago referred to the above doubletriplethreat concept, citing Scotts writing, as even the secret formula to becoming a CEO. All successful CEOs are like this. He reiterated that you could also cultivate this in school by getting unusual combinations of degrees, like engineering MBA, law degree MBA, or undergrad physics economics.

Overcoming Peer Pressure, Plus the Value of Stupid Goals There was an amazing situation where I was in Japan at this competition called the Toyota Big Air, and I was a wildcard entry. I was paying my travel to get there. My mom flew out with me. Were paying for the hotel, were paying for the food, all these things. All the other riders were invited and had flights and hotels covered. When they got there, they got paid per diem daily compensation money to show up, and then theres a big prize purse of 50K. Everyone went out that night and partied like crazy, and I was a kid, so I was at the hotel with my mom. They show up hungover to the event, and theyre like, You know, the jumps just lamebecause theyre snowboarders, soIts not cool, and we dont want to compete today. Were just gonna do a demo, and were all going to split the money. Im doing the quick math and I think, Man, this doesnt even cover our flights out. And so I said, I dont want to do it. I dont want to split the money. They hazed me and said, Oh, youre all about the money . . . and I just sat there Im riding really well today. Im not doing it. They had a big picture of all the riders faces and theyre drawing dollar signs on my eyes. I was like 15. That was intimidating. My heroes making jabs at me, and man, I won. . . . It was 50K and a car. I was like, Oh my God! What do we do? TIM What were the sources of that strength in the face of that type of peer pressure? Thats unusual for a 15yearold, especially when youre being faced by your idols who are suddenly throwing darts at you. Did that come from your parents? Or is it just something that youve always had, or is there a different answer? SHAUN Id put in the work, Id put in the time, I felt like I was the best rider, and these guys had their travel paid to get there. . . . I just thought, you know what? This is my day, and Im not going to let them ruin it. Id worked toward this goal. You know, I usually set goals. Every single season I set a goal . . . its usually two goals. Its something very serious and something funny, something stupid. TIM Like what? What would be an example of each? SHAUN Youre going to laughits ridiculous. One of them was to win the Olympics, and then one of them was to see how many cars I could win. Because, at the time, the automotive industries were just handing out cars. I was on a roll, and I think by the end of the run I had nine cars. There was a Suzuki Sidekick and this Volvo, and a Jeep, and these random cars. . . . I ended up donating them at the end, because I wouldve had to pay taxes on them and all these things. TIM Do you still set goals like that? SHAUN I do, yeah. Theyre always random, man. The Vancouver OlympicsI cant believe Im telling you thismy goals were, again, to win the Olympics, and then the other goal was to wear some pants, and the pants that I had made were American flag pants. Just follow me . . . I saw this photo of Axl Rose wearing something similar. They were probably a little snugger and shorter. I was like, I cant pull that off, but I can make some pants like that. It was just this stupid goal, like, Man, if I won, maybe I can get on the cover of Rolling Stone or something like that. . . . But thats whats fun, as it takes a lot of the pressure off. Winning the Olympics is a very big goal, its a very stressful goal to have. So its nice to have something else to offset it. Everything was so serious at the time and that was just my way of dealing with it. TF Shaun got the Rolling Stone cover wearing the American flag pants.

On Being an Outlier Sometimes, being outside of the known hotspots is a huge advantagesomething Malcolm Gladwell page 572 explores in his book Outliers. The following story from Shaun also reminded me of Richard Bettss logic for choosing restaurants on page 565 I was reading Outliers and I was amazed by the story about the hockey players and this kind of anomaly in the system. I started applying that to my own life and thought, Well, people would think I was at a disadvantage growing up in Southern California. Well, I dont find that a disadvantage at all. It was probably sunny and nice out the majority of the year or the winter season. Our winters arent like somewhere in Colorado or Vermont. So the number of days I could actually go ride was probably, I dont know, double or triple the amount of someone growing up somewhere else. Then, at the same time, the person who was building the parks at Bear Mountain and Snow Summit Resort in Southern Californiait was this small mountainso the management was like, Oh, yeah, do what you want, and this guy was building these amazing jumps, this amazing half pipe. He now builds all of the courses for the worlds best events. Thats where he got his start, at these mountains. You know they werent going to let him go to Aspen and tear up the groomer trail or whatever. Also, the half pipe had a Tbar, like a tow rope, on it. So I was thinking, Wow, the number of days now that Im riding because its sunny, and the number of runs Im getting because I dont have to unstrap and hike back up. I would just do my trick, get back on the chair, and go back up. I realized, Im packing in months of training in these small windows, compared to someone else who lives in Vermont or something, where its well below freezing and they are hiking the pike. Theyre tired. You know, when youre cold, its frightening to go, Okay, Im going to try this flip. No, youre not. Its superintimidating now, its cold, and you want to go home and get warm. I was in these conditions where the snow was soft, I had some guy building the best terrain around, and so . . . a lot of fun things that I was able to apply to my life from that book. Take the Gig and Look for Other Doors to Open Music was a strange one, just because no one else in my family is musical in the slightest. . . . I won a guitar at a snowboard contest and I thought, Wow, what if I could just be at a party somewhere and play one song? and one song turned into Okay, Im now training to be a guitar player. . . . I play lead guitar in a band called Bad Things. Its composed of mostly friends of mine from the neighborhood I grew up in and some amazingly talented guys I met in L.A. We started making our own songs, and we got offered some gigs, and there was one moment where we got invited to go to Lollapalooza. And I was like, Man, this will be heavy. TF At this point in the story, I said Wow . . . in a hushed tone. Just wait . . . it was for the kids stage. So I said, You know what would be so punk rock? If we just go and play that kids stage. Because I dont think I should be on the main stage. Just because Im in the group does not mean that we should be given those scenarios. So we show up, and we did our thing. We had a really great show for the kids. Then the most amazing thing happened. It was like out of a movie. The main act on the Grove stage at Lollapalooza decided they werent going to play. They put a big sign out that said, Our art will not be displayed here. Their fans completely demolished their gear and all this craziness ensued. They the organizers looked around, like, We need a band to play the main stage. And I said, Were a band. Literally, Were a band. It was crazy. They said, You, come with us. I thought, Oh my God, this is our moment, we gotta do this. And so we played one of the most incredible sets weve ever had. We rose to the occasion. We had this amazing set, and just like anyone who picks up a guitar and dreams of being on stage, you dream of that moment youre walking off stage and everyone is cheering for one more song. And the best moment of thatI look'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

Literally, Were a band. It was crazy. They said, You, come with us. I thought, Oh my God, this is our moment, we gotta do this. And so we played one of the most incredible sets weve ever had. We rose to the occasion. We had this amazing set, and just like anyone who picks up a guitar and dreams of being on stage, you dream of that moment youre walking off stage and everyone is cheering for one more song. And the best moment of thatI look at my buddies, and theyre just like, Do we even have another song? We dont have another one. The organizer said, Play the first one again. Fifty Shades of Chicken Thats the title of Shauns mostgifted book. Totally serious. I assumed it would be a complete joke, but it has nearly 700 reviews on Amazon and a 4.8star average. The Law of Category In the world of ideas, to name something is to own it. If you can name an issue, you can own the issue. Thomas L. Friedman I constantly recommend that entrepreneurs read The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing by Al Ries and Jack Trout, whether they are firsttime founders or serial homerun hitters launching a new product. The Law of the Category is the chapter I revisit most often, and Ive included a condensed version below. It was originally published in 1993, so some of the today references are dated, but the principles are timeless. The Law of the Category Whats the name of the third person to fly the Atlantic Ocean solo? If you didnt know that Bert Hinkler was the second person to fly the Atlantic, you might figure you had no chance at all to know the name of the third person. But you do. Its Amelia Earhart. Now, is Amelia known as the third person to fly the Atlantic Ocean solo, or as the first woman to do so? After Heineken became a big success, the people at AnheuserBusch could have said, We should bring in an imported beer, too. But they didnt. Instead they said, If theres a market for a highpriced imported beer, maybe theres a market for a highpriced domestic beer. And so they started to promote Michelob, the first highpriced domestic beer, which shortly thereafter outsold Heineken two to one. Actually, AnheuserBusch also brought in an imported beer, Carlsberg, which has a very good reputation in Europe. In the United States, however, the metoo Carlsberg never went anywhere. Miller Lite was the first domestic light. It took an importer 5 years to say, If theres a market for a domestic light beer, maybe theres a market for an imported light beer. The result was Amstel Light, which became the largestselling imported light beer. If you didnt get into the prospects mind first, dont give up hope. Find a new category you can be first in. Its not as difficult as you might think. After IBM became a big success in computers, everybody and his brother jumped into the field. Burroughs, Control Data, General Electric, Honeywell, NCR, RCA, Sperry. Snow White and the seven dwarfs, they were called. Which dwarf grew up to become a worldwide powerhouse, with 126,000 employees and sales of 14 billion, a company often dubbed the second largest computer company in the world? None of them. The most successful computer company of the seventies and eighties, next to IBM, was Digital Equipment Corporation. IBM was first in computers. DEC was first in minicomputers. Many other computer companies and their entrepreneurial owners became rich and famous by following a simple principle If you cant be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in. Tandem was first in faulttolerant computers and built a 1.9 billion business. So Stratus stepped down with the first faulttolerant minicomputer. Are the laws of marketing difficult? No, they are quite simple. Working things out in practice is another matter, however. Cray Research went over the top with the first supercomputer. So Convex put two and two together and launched the first mini supercomputer. Sometimes you can also turn an alsoran into a winner by inventing a new category. Commodore was just another manufacturer of home personal computers that wasnt going anywhere until it positioned the Amiga as the first multimedia computer. There are many different ways to be first. Dell got into the crowded personal computer field by being the first to sell computers by phone. When you launch a new product, the first question to ask yourself is not How is this new product better than the competition? but First what? In other words, what category is this new product first in? Charles Schwab didnt open a better brokerage firm. He opened the first discount broker. This is counter to classic marketing thinking, which is brand oriented How do I get people to prefer my brand? Forget the brand. Think categories. Prospects are on the defensive when it comes to brands. Everyone talks about why their brand is better. But prospects have an open mind when it comes to categories. Everyone is interested in whats new. Few people are interested in whats better. When youre the first in a new category, promote the category. In essence, you have no competition.

DEC told its prospects why they ought to buy a minicomputer, not a DEC minicomputer. In the early days, Hertz sold rentacar service. CocaCola sold refreshment. Marketing programs of both companies were more effective back then. TF Much like DEC and minicomputers, I created the term lifestyle design and debuted it in The 4Hour Workweek. Heres how it first appeared, with a few paragraphs removed The New Rich NR are those who abandon the deferredlife plan save and retire after 2040 years and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich time and mobility. This is an art and a science we will refer to as Lifestyle Design LD. . . . 1,000,000 in the bank isnt the fantasy. The fantasy is the lifestyle of complete freedom it supposedly allows. The question is then, How can one achieve the millionaire lifestyle of complete freedom without first having 1,000,000? Tools and principles follow, like geoarbitrage, email triage, luxury travel workaround, and miniretirements another term I created, etc. Lifestyle design represented a new and concise label for something that previously required a few sentences. I made no attempt to trademark or protect it. Instead, I propagated it as widely as possible as quickly as possible, seeded it in media interviews, conference keynotes, articles, and elsewhere. I wanted it to enter the popular vernacular, and to have organic communities of lifestyle designers sprout up online and all over the world. Once The 4Hour Workweek was parodied by Jay Leno and The Office, it had arrived. The side effect was thatat least for the first yearwhenever lifestyle design was used or defined by someone, my name or The 4Hour Workweek were mentioned as well. This was because I owned the mindshare, the mental category, not the trademark. Now, of course, its out in the wild, all grown up, and has taken on a life of its own. At the time of this writing, there are 14.6 million or 585K Google search results for lifestyle design, depending on whether you omit or use quotation marks. I dont create art to get highdollar projects, I do highdollar projects so I can create more art.

Chase is also the first person to introduce me to a Moscow Mule spicy ginger beer, vodka, lime juice. On our first visit to the White House, he was repeatedly yelled off the lawn by security, as he was finding optimal angles for selfies. I legitimately thought he was going to get Tasered. For the rest of the day, I would shout GET OFF THE GRASS! whenever he stepped on grass around D.C., and hed jump like a cat seeing a cucumber Google it. Worth the price of this book. Creativity is an infinite resource. The more you spend,the more you have. This was Chase paraphrasing a quote from Maya Angelou and discussing how creativity and meditation are similar. On His First Sale The first sale came about because I grew up skiing and snowboarding, and I was very familiar with the subject. I got in with a good crowd of athletes and had photographs of people on next years equipment, because I knew the manufacturers and reps.

I said Ill get back to you on that to play it cool, and I felt like I was going to go throw up in the bathroom. There were some stakes there . . . it was an indicator of where I wanted to go. I knew I wanted to be a top price point. I wanted to do less work, and do highend stuff. Now, I dont want to pretend I didnt do a shitload. This is like a 10year, overnight success program . . . I was eating, breathing, sleeping photography, and then when I was able to start to monetize my craft, I did so at a very high price point. Little note If someone ever says yes that quickly, you didnt ask for enough. TF Chase and I share many philosophies, including this one. I didnt accept advertisers for the podcast until I had 100K downloads per episode, as measured at the industrystandard 6 weeks postpublication. Why? Novice podcasters which I was, bloggers, and artists of all types get too distracted in nascent stages with monetization. For podcasting In the first 3 to 9 months, you should be honing your craft and putting out increasingly better work. Good content is the best SEO, as Robert Scoble originally told me. You have fundamentally two choices, and the majority of people choose Option A. Option A You can waste 30 to 50 of your time persuading a few small sponsors to commit early, then stall at 30K downloads per episode because youre neglecting the creative. Things are even worse if you get mired in the world of sketchy affiliate deals. Option B You can play the long game, wait 6 to 12 months until you have a critical mass, then get to 300K downloads per episode and make more than 10 times per episode with much larger brands who can afford to scale with you as you grow. Haste makes waste. In this case, it can easily make the difference between 50K per year and more than 1 million per year. Amplify Your Strengths Rather Than Fix Your Weaknesses Everything is a remix, but what is your version of the remix? Say I have a relationship with a bunch of celebrities, so I might be able to get a photograph of them that no one else could because they were on my couch playing PlayStation. . . . The point is thinking about, What is the unique mojo that I bring, and how can I try and amplify that? Amplify your strengths rather than fix your weaknesses. If youre not the best person at capturing something visually, but youre a good storyteller, you have your visual art, then you have an incredible narrative to go with it. When you go into art galleriesand I dont have the budget for it, but Im a classicaltype guyyoull see stuff on the wall for 10 million, and you cant figure out what it is. You read the plaque next to it and youre like, Thats a damn good story. I see how theyre selling these things. Different, Not Just Better I took a lot of cues from Andy Warhol, JeanMichel Basquiat he took graffiti off the street and brought it into the gallery, and Robert Rauschenberg largescale guy, crazy mixed media, the artists in New York in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s because they were hackers. . . . Some of them were making art about making art. They were reinventing the game while they were playing it. If I look across and everyone else is doing X, how do you zig when everyone else is zagging? The way that I zigged when everyone else was zagging in photography was I chronicled my exploits of learning my craft. . . . It was 10 years before it was cool to be transparent, and I was actually vilified for sharing trade secrets.

Specialization Is for Insects As Heinlein Would Say I was told my whole career You have to specialize, specialize. I specialized in pursuing the things that interested me. I talked a lot about action sports, but then I also talked about fashion, break dancing, and all kinds of different cultural stuff. Ive made TV shows, shot commercials, done ad campaigns, created startups, and made the first iPhone app that shared images to social networks.

Spirit animal Common swift Ramit Sethi Ramit Sethi TWIG ramit, iwillteachyoutoberich.com graduated from Stanford University in 2005 with bachelors and masters degrees in technology, psychology, and sociology. He grew his personal finance blog to more than 1 million readers per month, then turned this college side project into a multimilliondollar business with more than 30 employees. Some of his weeks now break 5 million in revenue. In a finance space saturated by gurus of dubious credentials, Ramit has always been willing to share real numbers. Behind the Scenes Ramit and I often laugh about how we are blessed and cursed with scammysounding book titles. I Will Teach You to Be Rich and The 4Hour Workweek are about as bad as it gets. Easy to remember, hard to live down. Every few years for the last 20 years, Ramit has read Iacocca An Autobiography by Lee Iacocca and William Novak. A Man Called Ass My actual birth name was Amit, which is a much more common Indian name. About 2 days after I was born, my dad woke up, rolled over, and told my mom, We cannot name him Amit because his initials will be ASS. And the best part is, like true immigrantsmy parents are from Indiathey went to the hospital, and they didnt want to pay the 50 change fee, so they told them that they had forgotten to add an R and they got it for free. Thanks, Mom and Dad. TF On a related note, I recently got this text from Ramit Btw I think I told you how my sisters wanted to get a dog for 15 years. We couldnt because my dad is allergic. Only . . . we found out hes not. He just lied to us because he hates pets. Are You J. Crew? We send millions of emails a month with multiplemillion combinatorial variants of email funnels, and we generate roughly 99 of our revenue through email. My emails look like plain emails. . . . I am not J. Crew. J. Crew is selling a brand, so their emails have to be beautiful. My emails look like I am writing to you because I want to be your friend . . . at scale. That is why my emails appear to be really simple. Behind the scenes, there is a lot of stuff going on, but they appear . . . like I just jotted you a note. TF One of the reasons I put off using email newsletters for years was perceived complexity. I didnt want to have to craft beautiful templates and ship out gorgeous, magazineworthy missives. Ramit convinced me to send plaintext email for my 5Bullet Friday newsletter, which became one of the most powerful parts of my business within 6 months.

Indian people do not get punched in the face, dude. They do not get in fights. We are doing spelling bees. For some godforsaken reason, I asked Ramit, Do you remember the last time you were punched in the face? He answered with the above. 1,000 True Fans 1,000 True Fans by Kevin Kelly was one of the seminal articles that inspired me to really build amazing material, rather than just recycling what else was out there. I knew that if I had 1,000 true fans, then not only would I be able to live doing the things I wanted, but I would be able to turn that into 2,000, 5,000, 10,000and that is exactly what happened. In terms of getting my first 1,000 true fans, you can look at my posts. They tend to be very, very long and definitive. In some cases, 15, 20, 25 pages long. . . . If your material is good, if it is engaging, there is almost no maximum you can write. . . . My point is not write longer. It is do not worry about space. Second, I cannot recommend guest posting enough. I did one for you The Psychology of Automationthat probably took me 20 to 25 hours to write. It was very detailed. It included video, all kinds of stuff, and to this day a lot of the people I meet, I ask, How did you hear about me? and they say, Oh, through Tim Ferriss. TF For the launch of The 4Hour Workweek, I used this same guest posting strategy on Gigaom, Lifehacker, and other sites. I give away 98 of my material for free and, then, many of my flagship courses are extremely expensive. In fact, 10 to 100 times what my competitors charge. TF I have mirrored Ramits approach to pricing and selling. I rarely sell highticket items, but when I do, I charge 10 to 100 times what competitors might. In general, I split my content in a very binary fashion free or ultrapremium. Free means that 99 of what I do is free to the world e.g., podcast, blog or nearly free books. I write on topics that A I enjoy and want to learn more about, and that B I think will attract intelligent, driven, and accomplished people. This is what allows ultrapremium. Ultrapremium means Once in a blue moon, I offer a highpriced and very limited product or opportunity, such as an event with 200 seats at 7.5K to 10K per seat. I can sell out a scarce, ultrapremium opportunity within 48 hours with a single blog post, as I did with my Opening the Kimono OTK event in Napa. Of course, then you have to overdeliver. My measurement of customer satisfaction? The Facebook group established for attendees is still active . . . 5 years later. I use the network and contacts Ive built through free to find excellent noncontent opportunities, such as earlystage tech investing. I found Shopify, for instance, via my fans on Twitter while updating The 4Hour Workweek. I started advising Shopify when they had 10 employees. Now they have more than 1,000 and are a publicly traded company SHOP. Fans on social media recommended Duolingo to me when it was in private betatesting, and I invested in the first round of financing. Now, they have 100 million users and are the worlds most popular languagelearning software. An openness to indirect paths means I dont obsess over selling my content, and I never have. My network, partially built through writing, is my net worth. If you want to increase your income 10x instead of 10, the best opportunities are often seemingly out of left field e.g., books startups. Checklists Ramit and I are both obsessed with checklists and love a book by Atul Gawande titled The Checklist Manifesto. I have this book on a shelf in my living room, cover out, as a constant reminder. Atul Gawande is also one of Malcolm Gladwells page 572 favorite innovators. Ramit builds checklists for as many business processes as possible, which he organizes using software called Basecamp. Google entrepreneurial bus count for a good article on why checklists can save your startup. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? I think of a guy I recently met named Mark Bustos. He has an awesome Instagram account markbustos and is a very highend hairdresser in New York. He works at a top salon, and on the weekend, he goes and he cuts the hair of homeless people around New York. He records it, and he writes about their stories. I think it is so amazing that he is at the top of game as a hairdresser, working with celebrity clients and things like that, and then on the weekendon his one day offhe goes around and is of service to people who ordinarily would never have the chance to get their hair cut, especially by'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

I have this book on a shelf in my living room, cover out, as a constant reminder. Atul Gawande is also one of Malcolm Gladwells page 572 favorite innovators. Ramit builds checklists for as many business processes as possible, which he organizes using software called Basecamp. Google entrepreneurial bus count for a good article on why checklists can save your startup. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? I think of a guy I recently met named Mark Bustos. He has an awesome Instagram account markbustos and is a very highend hairdresser in New York. He works at a top salon, and on the weekend, he goes and he cuts the hair of homeless people around New York. He records it, and he writes about their stories. I think it is so amazing that he is at the top of game as a hairdresser, working with celebrity clients and things like that, and then on the weekendon his one day offhe goes around and is of service to people who ordinarily would never have the chance to get their hair cut, especially by somebody like him. Two people Ramit has learned from or followed closely in the last year Jay Abraham and Charlie Munger. TF Jay Abraham is one of Daymond Johns page 323 mentors and the author of Getting Everything You Can Out of All Youve Got, which is one of Ramits mostgifted books. I often recommend Jays work to people who ask about how to structure JVs, or joint ventures. Its Been a Long Time . . . and You Are Fat If you are overweight and you get off the plane in India, the first thing your family is going to say is Wow, you got fat. TF If you want to be this brutally honest in the U.S., I suggest first reading my friend A.J. Jacobss Esquire piece titled I Think Youre Fat. 1,000 True FansRevisited I have recommended Kevin Kellys 1,000 True Fans to literally millions of people. Many guests in this book have done the same. If you only read one article on marketing, make it this one is my common wording. Heres a highly simplified synopsis Success need not be complicated. Just start with making 1,000 people extremely, extremely happy. Kevins original piece has grown outdated in a few places, so he was kind enough to write up a newer summary of core concepts for readers of this book. Since I first read the original nearly 10 years ago, Ive tested his concepts across dozens of businesses, many of which are now multibilliondollar companies. Ive added some of my core learnings and recommendations at the end. Enter Kevin I first published this idea in 2008, when it was embryonic and ragged, and now, 8 years later, my original essay needs an updateby someone other than me. Here Ill simply restate the core ideas, which I believe will be useful to anyone making things, or making things happen.KK To be a successful creator, you dont need millions. You dont need millions of dollars or millions of customers, clients, or fans. To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only 1,000 true fans. A true fan is defined as a fan who will buy anything you produce. These diehard fans will drive 200 miles to see you sing they will buy the hardback and paperback and audio versions of your book they will purchase your next figurine, sight unseen they will pay for the bestof DVD version of your free YouTube channel they will come to your chefs table once a month they will buy the superdeluxe reissued hires box set of your stuff even though they have the lowres version. They have a Google Alert set for your name they bookmark the eBay page where your outofprint editions show up they come to your openings. They have you sign their copies they buy the Tshirt, and the mug, and the hat they cant wait till you issue your next work. They are true fans. If you have roughly 1,000 fans like this also known as superfans, you can make a livingif you are content to make a living, but not a fortune. Heres how the math works. You need to meet two criteria First, you have to create enough each year that you can earn, on average, 100 profit from each true fan. That is easier to do in some arts and businesses than others, but it is a good creative challenge in every area because it is always easier and better to give your existing customers more, than it is to find new fans. Second, you must have a direct relationship with your fans. That is, they must pay you directly. You get to keep all of their support, unlike the small percentage of their fees you might get from a music label, publisher, studio, retailer, or other intermediate. If you keep the full 100 from each true fan, then you need only 1,000 of them to earn 100K per year. Thats a living for most folks. 1,000 customers is a whole lot more feasible to aim for than a million fans. Millions of paying fans is just not a realistic goal to shoot for, especially when you are starting out. But 1,000 fans is doable. You might even be able to remember 1,000 names. If you added one new true fan per day, itd only take a few years to gain 1,000. True fanship is doable. Pleasing a true fan is pleasurable and invigorating. It rewards the artist to remain true, to focus on the unique aspects of their work, the qualities that true fans appreciate. The number 1,000 is not absolute. Its significance is in its rough order of magnitude3 orders less than a million. The actual number has to be adjusted for'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

Its significance is in its rough order of magnitude3 orders less than a million. The actual number has to be adjusted for each person. If you are able to only earn 50 per year per true fan, then you need 2,000. Likewise, if you can sell 200 per year, you need only 500 true fans. Or you many need only 75K per year to live on, so you adjust downward. Or if you are a duet, or have a partner, then you need to multiply by 2 to get 2,000 fans, etc. Another way to calculate the support of a true fan is to aim to get one day of their wages per year. Can you excite or please them sufficiently to earn what they make from one days labor? Thats a high bar, but not impossible for 1,000 people worldwide. And of course, not every fan will be super. While the support of 1,000 true fans may be sufficient for a living, for every single true fan, you might have 2 or 3 regular fans. Think of concentric circles with true fans at the center and a wider circle of regular fans around them. These regular fans may buy your creations occasionally, or may have bought only once. But their ordinary purchases expand your total income. Perhaps they bring in an additional 50. Still, you want to focus on the superfans because the enthusiasm of true fans can increase the patronage of regular fans. True fans are not only the direct source of your income, but also your chief marketing force for the ordinary fans. Fans, customers, patrons have been around forever. Whats new here? A couple of things. While direct relationships with customers was the default mode in old times, the benefits of modern retailing meant that most creators in the last century did not have direct contact with consumers. Often even the publishers, studios, labels, and manufacturers did not have such crucial information as the names of their customers. For instance, despite being in business for hundreds of years, no New York book publisher knew the names of their core and dedicated readers. For previous creators, these intermediates and there was often more than one meant you need much larger audiences to have a success. With the advent of ubiquitous peertopeer communication and payment systemsalso known as the web todayeveryone has access to excellent tools that allow anyone to sell directly to anyone else in the world. So a creator in Bend, Oregon, can sell and deliver a song to someone in Kathmandu, Nepal, as easily as a New York record label maybe even more easily. This new technology permits creators to maintain relationships so that the customer can become a fan, and so that the creator keeps the total amount of payment, which reduces the number of fans needed. This new ability for the creator to retain the full price is revolutionary, but a second technological innovation amplifies that power further. A fundamental virtue of a peertopeer network like the web is that the most obscure node is only one click away from the most popular node. In other words, the most obscure, underselling book, song, or idea is only one click away from the bestselling book, song, or idea. Early in the rise of the web, the large aggregators of content and products, such as eBay, Amazon, Netflix, etc., noticed that the total sales of all the lowestselling obscure items would equal, or in some cases exceed, the sales of the few bestselling items. Chris Anderson my successor at Wired named this effect the Long Tail, for the visually graphed shape of the sales distribution curve a low, nearly interminable line of items selling only a few copies per year that form a long tail for the abrupt vertical beast of a few bestsellers. But the area of the tail was as big as the head. With that insight, the aggregators had great incentive to encourage audiences to click on the obscure items. They invented recommendation engines and other algorithms to channel attention to the rare creations in the long tail. Even web search companies like Google, Bing, and Baidu found it in their interests to reward searchers with the obscure because they could sell ads in the long tail as well. The result was that the most obscure became less obscure. If you live in any of the 2 million small towns on Earth, you might be the only one in your town to crave death metal music, or get turned on by whispering, or want a lefthanded fishing reel. Before the web, youd never have a way to satisfy that desire. Youd be alone in your fascination. But now, satisfaction is only one click away. Whatever your interests as a creator are, your 1,000 true fans are one click from you.

Whatever your interests as a creator are, your 1,000 true fans are one click from you. As far as I can tell there is nothingno product, no idea, no desirewithout a fan base on the Internet. Everything made or thought of can interest at least one person in a millionits a low bar. Yet if even only one out of a million people were interested, thats potentially 7,000 people on the planet. That means that any 1inamillion appeal can find 1,000 true fans. The trick is to practically find those fans, or, more accurately, to have them find you. One of the many new innovations serving the true fan creator is crowdfunding. Having your fans finance your next product is genius. Winwin all around. There are about 2,000 different crowdfunding platforms worldwide, many of them specializing in specific fields raising money for science experiments, bands, or documentaries. Each has its own requirements and a different funding model, in addition to specialized interests. Some platforms require allornothing funding goals others permit partial funding some raise money for completed projects some, like Patreon, fund ongoing projects. Patreon supporters might fund a monthly magazine, or a video series, or an artists salary. The most famous and largest crowdfunder is Kickstarter, which has raised 2.5 billion for more than 100,000 projects. The average number of supporters for a successful Kickstarter project is 241 fundersfar less than 1,000. That means if you have 1,000 true fans, you can do a crowdfunding campaign, because by definition a true fan will become a Kickstarter funder. Although the success of your campaign is dependent on what you ask of your fans. The truth is that cultivating 1,000 true fans is timeconsuming, sometimes nervewracking, and not for everyone. Done well and why not do it well? it can become another fulltime job. At best, it will be a consuming and challenging parttime task that requires ongoing skills. There are many creators who dont want to deal with fans, and honestly should not. They should just paint, or sew, or make music, and hire someone else to deal with their superfans. If that is you, and you add someone to deal with fans, a helper will skew your formula, increasing the number of fans you need, but that might be the best mix. If you go that far, then why not subcontract out dealing with fans to the middle peoplethe labels and studios and publishers and retailers? If they work for you, fine, but remember, in most cases they would be even worse at this than you would. The mathematics of 1,000 true fans is not a binary choice. You dont have to go this route to the exclusion of another. Many creators, including me, will use direct relations with superfans in addition to mainstream intermediaries. I have been published by several bigtime New York publishers, I have selfpublished, and I have used Kickstarter to publish to my true fans. I chose each format depending on the content and my aim. But in every case, cultivating my true fans enriches the route I choose. The takeaway 1,000 true fans is an alternative path to success other than stardom. Instead of trying to reach the narrow and unlikely peaks of platinum bestseller hits, blockbusters, and celebrity status, you can aim for direct connection with 1,000 true fans. On your way, no matter how many fans you actually succeed in gaining, youll be surrounded not by faddish infatuation, but by genuine and true appreciation. Its a much saner destiny to hope for. And you are much more likely to actually arrive there. Some Thoughts from Tim Kevin distinguishes between making a living and making a fortune, which is an important starting point for the discussion. However, its worth noting that these arent necessarily mutually exclusive.

There are certainly ace CEOs who thread the needle and enjoy this roller coaster, but they are outliers. Read Small Giants by Bo Burlingham for some fantastic examples of companies that choose to be the best rather than the biggest. And, as Kevin noted, the number of your true fans can actually be far fewer than 1,000. This is particularly true if you A produce content that attracts a niche but wellheeled group, and then B invite and look for indirect revenue opportunities not based on onsite transactions e.g., paid speaking, investment opportunities, consulting. These can be far more lucrative than most advertising, tip jars, and the like. One reasonably common critique of 1,000 True Fans comes from musicians, for instance, who say something along the lines of, But I can only sell an album for 10, and I can only produce one per year. Thats only 10K and not enough to live on. 1,000 True Fans doesnt work. Scores of book writers have a similar argument, but its flawed. Remember, a true true fan will buy whatever you put out. If they refuse to purchase above 10, you havent done the work to find and cultivate real true fans. If you have true fans, its your responsibility to consider and test higherpriced, highervalue options outside of the 10 paradigm. Dont be locked in the pricing model of the incumbents. In 2015, WuTang Clan sold a single bespoke album at auctionin a handcrafted silver and nickel box made by BritishMoroccan artist Yahyato one person for 2 million. There are a lot of options between 10 and 2 million. See my free or ultrapremium approach on page 290, which has provided me with complete creative and financial freedom. You do not have to sacrifice the integrity of your art for a respectable income. You just need to create a great experience and charge enough. Not sure what to charge? Perhaps you should figure out your Target Monthly Income TMI for your ideal lifestyle and work backward. For examples and a simple worksheet exercise, visit fourhourworkweek.comtmi Hacking Kickstarter How to Raise 100K in 10 Days The below is written by Mike Del Ponte, one of the founders of Soma, a startup I advise FBIGTW somawater, drinksoma.com. He raised 100K on Kickstarter in 10 days, and I asked him to share some of the best tools and tricks you can use to replicate his success. Note that VA in the below refers to virtual assistant, which he finds through Upwork or Zirtual. Enter Mike How many times have you dreamt of launching a new product, only to let your dream fall to the wayside? I dont have the money to even get started! What if it fails? In the past, these excuses held some weight, as bringing a new product to market could be incredibly expensive. Oftentimes, you had to prototype, build, and then hope the world wanted what you were selling. If not, you could end up with a warehouse full of debt unsellable inventory. Now, there are new options. Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow you to introduce test a new product before you start manufacturing, removing a huge amount of risk. If people like what youre proposing, you can pull in thousands or even millions of dollars to fund your dream. At the very worst, you were able to test your idea without investing much time or money. But planning and running a Kickstarter campaign is often done in a haphazard fashion. To prepare for ours, we didnt want to leave anything to chance, so we interviewed 15 of the topearning Kickstarter creators. Ive worked with PR firms that charge 20K a month and spend 3 months planning a launch. Follow our advicebased on what we learnedand theres a good chance youll get better results without spending anything. Using virtual assistants, growthhacking techniques, and principles from Tims books, we raised more than 100K in less than 10 days. Having accomplished our goal with almost 30 days to spare, we were able to relax for the holidays. Here are just a few of the nonobvious keys we learned. Find the MED for Kickstarter Traffic If you want to raise a lot of money on Kickstarter, you need to drive a lot of traffic to your project. And you want that traffic to be comprised of prospective backers of your project. Applying the concept of MED minimum effective dose from The 4Hour Body, we knew we needed to discover and focus on the best traffic sources. My friend Clay Hebert is a Kickstarter expert. One of the things he taught me is a simple trick using bit.ly tracking. Bit.ly is a link shortening service used by millions of people . . . and Kickstarter.

If you add a to the end of any bit.ly URL, you can see stats related to that link. For example Here are stats for the shortlink Kickstarter generated for our campaign httpkck.stVjAFva TF This will blow your mind. Go to any Kickstarter project, click on Share, and pick a social network, like Twitter. A prepopulated tweet will appear with a shortlink. Copy and paste the link alone into a new tab, add to the end, and hit Return. Voil. To discover the top referral sources, we gave our VA a list of Kickstarter projects similar to ours and asked her to list the referrers for each project. Based on this data, we decided to focus all of our attention on just two goals Getting coverage on the right blogs Activating our networks to create buzz on Facebook, Twitter, and email We knew that if we did this, we would be listed in Kickstarters Popular Projects sections, which is how you get people who are browsing Kickstarter to check out and back your project. Find Relevant Bloggers Using Google Images Start by looking at who covered Kickstarter projects similar to yours. You can do this by using a simple Google Images hack. If you drag and drop any image file into the search bar at images.google.com, youll be shown every website that has ever posted that image. Pretty cool, huh? Heres the process your VA will use Find 10 Kickstarter projects similar to yours, and for each, do the followingRightclick and savetodesktop 2 to 3 images. Drag and drop each image file from your desktop into the Google Images search bar. Review blogs listed on the results page to see which might be relevant to your project. Fill out the following fields in a Media List spreadsheet which you create publication, URL, first and last name of the writer, and links to relevant posts by that writer. You now have dozens of blogs that have a high probability of relevance, all neatly organized in a spreadsheet. Your VA can find more sites like the ones in your media list by searching SimilarSites.com. Research Site Traffic on SimilarWeb.com or Alexa.com Bigger is not always better, but it is helpful to know the size of each blogs readership. Have your VA research how many unique monthly visitors each blog has and add that data to your spreadsheet. TF I personally use the SimilarWeb Chrome extension. Identify Relationships on Facebook This may be the most important part of your PR efforts. For us, 8 out of 10 valuable blog posts resulted from relationships. When we pitched a blogger without a relationship, less than 1 even responded. With introductions, our success rate was over 50. How do you identify relationships? Facebook. Have your VA log in to your Facebook account, search for bloggers in your media list, and add mutual friends to your spreadsheet. You can also search on professional networks like LinkedIn. Use the Right Tools TextExpander allows you to paste any saved messagewhether its a phone number or a twopage emailinto any document or text field, simply by typing an abbreviation. This is extremely helpful for repetitive outreach. Its a musthave app that probably saved us 1 to 2 hours a day in typing. One tool that we did not use, but should have, is Boomerang, a Gmail plugin that allows you to schedule emails. We crafted emails to our influencers and intheknow friends the day of our launch, using TextExpander, then slightly customized each one. What we should have done is written and saved these personalized emails a few days before we launched. That way, we could have scheduled them to be automatically sent by Boomerang the second we launched. This would have freed up many valuable hours on launch day. TF For perhaps 10 additional tips, as well as a half dozen email templates that Soma used for their PR outreach and launch this alone could save you more than 100 hours, visit fourhourworkweek.comkickstarter Occasionally, a good idea comes to you first, if youre lucky.

Good questions are what open people up, open new doors, and create opportunities. In GeneralAsk the Dumb Question Everyone Else Is Afraid to Ask Often, theres a very basic, very dumb question at the center of a story that no ones asking. One of the biggest stories I ever did, The Giant Pool of Money, was predicated on just such a dumb question Why are the banks loaning money to people who cant possibly pay it back? Asking the right dumb question is often the smartest thing you can do. Malcolm Gladwell also discusses this on page 573. In ParticularUse the Right Questions and Prompts For Alex, good tape interviews must have stories as a primary ingredient, not uninformative yesorno answers. How does Alex elicit what he would call authentic moments of emotion? How do you get people to recount? To naturally tell funny stories? How do you make their lines memorableconcrete and specificnot abstract and general? Alex has spent more than 20 years thinking about this and testing different approaches. Alex generally tries to cover three bases setting e.g., where, when, who, what, emotions, and details. Here are some specific phrases that he uses, which Ive borrowed, and youll notice that pseudocommands are sometimes more effective than questions Prompts to Elicit Stories Most Interviewers Are Weak at This Tell me about a time when . . . Tell me about the day or moment or time when . . . Tell me the story of . . . how you came to major in X, how you met soandso, etc. Tell me about the day you realized . . . What were the steps that got you to ? Describe the conversation when . . . TF I often use the last with people who, at some point, were considering leaving a job to start a company. Ill say, Describe the conversation when you first mentioned to your wifehusband that you wanted to drop this lucrative career in X and start your own company. It has never failed to get a good story. FollowUp Questions When Something Interesting Comes Up, Perhaps in Passing How did that make you feel? What do you make of that? TF I will often say, Explain that a bit more . . . or What did you learn from that? GeneralUse Fishing Lures If the old you could see the new you, what would the new you say? You seem very confident now. Was that always the case? If you had to describe the debate in your head about X decision or event, how would you describe it? TF I often adapt the last to something like When you do X or When Y happened to you, what does your internal selftalk sound like? What do you say to yourself?

Audio can be infinitely complex, but you can keep it simple. As Morgan Spurlock page 221 might say, Once you get fancy, fancy gets broken. My suggestion is to start with recording phone interviews via Skype. It allows you to testdrive podcasting extremely cheaply, and it allows you to cheat to refer to questions, notes, and cheat sheets in Evernote or another program while speaking. It takes the pressure off. Inperson interviews are much harder to set up, harder to do well, and technically easier to screw up.

I havent found any software that blows me away, but this gets the job done. Ive used it for more than 50 of my podcast interviews.

AudioTechnica ATR2100USB cardioid dynamic USBXLR microphone This is my goto travel mic for all phone interviews. It can also be used for recording intros, sponsor reads, etc., with QuickTime. I often mail guests this mic via Amazon Prime if they need one, as it has the best bangforthebuck value Ive found. Be sure to use a foam ball windscreen or pop filter. Yellowtec iXm I use this mic for lastminute travel recording and postproduction intros. It is an amazing allinone mic, which allows you to record without a Zoom or laptop. It automatically corrects levels andquite franklyproduces the best audio of all the various mics I own. I use it for my intros Welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferris Show . . . and sponsor reads, which I record separately from the interviews. If Im traveling but might need a mic, I stick this in my backpack. This bad boy is pricey, but I love the quality and convenience. PostProduction and Editing Whatever I edited perhaps 20 of my first 30 episodes using GarageBand, despite disliking it. Why? Because I could learn it quickly, and it forced me to keep the podcast format dead simple. Fancy nonsense wasnt possible for a Luddite like me, nor for the software, and thats what I wanted a positive constraint. If GarageBand appears too amateur for your first 1 to 3 episodes, Id bet money 99 of you will quit by episode 5. Most wouldbe podcasters quit because they get overwhelmed with gear and editing. Much like Joe Rogan, I decided to record and publish entire conversations minimizing postproduction, not solely highlights. Keep it simple Here are a few options my editorsengineers have used Audacity free, Ableton, Sound Studio, and Hindenburg. If I were to learn another piece of editing software, I would likely choose Hindenburg. Auphonic I often use Auphonic.com to finalize and polish my podcasts after editing on the above. Its a webbased audio postproduction mastering tool, designed to help you improve the overall audio quality of your podcast. Things I Dont Use To date, I have not used any preamps, mixers, or other hardware. It would marginally improve things, but I havent found the additional complexity, added luggage, and risk of mechanical failure worth it.

To then become a public company, for the rest of us, because none of us had ever even been in a public company, let alone knowing what it means, we thought This could be a major distraction. . . . There was the view of Lets make some films and prove our worth and get that under our belt before we go public, but Steve had a different logic. He said, Right now, we have a threepicture deal with Disney. The financial profitsharing terms of the deal, while they were as good as we could have gotten under the circumstances, once we became a successful company, then our share of the profits was actually pretty small. So Steve wanted to renegotiate the deal, and all of us had a very good relationship with Disney. But Steve said at the end of 3 years, if we then split off as a separate company and were no longer with Disney, we will be their worst nightmare, because they will have helped launch a successful competitor. . . . All of this is before it happened, so were guessing whats going to happen. But this is Steve prognosticating, because he now believes the film is going to be a big success. So he said, What will happen is, as soon as the film is out, Michael Eisner will realize that hes helped create a competitor, so he will want to renegotiate, and if we renegotiate, then what we want is to be 5050 partners. I should say right there, thats a different Steve than years before, where Steve sort of shot for the fences and tried to get almost everything for himself. He now has reached the point where he said that is not a good place to be. A good place to be is a 5050 partnership. Its like a good standing. Its a high road to take. But if were 5050 partners, it also means that we have to put up half the money. Well, Pixar doesnt have any money. TIM Right. You need a war chest. ED So we needed a war chest. So if we go public, we will get a war chest. Then, when we renegotiate, we can come in and go for the kind of deal which is a 5050 deal. So the film came out, and within a few months, Steve got the call from Michael Eisner saying lets renegotiate. So Steve says, Okay, we want it to be 5050. All of that happened as Steve predicted it would. For me, it was rather amazing. Wow, he completely called it correctly. If You Cant Read It, Try Listening to It My brain works differently. It turns out I am unable to read poetry. . . . Reading poetry, within a few seconds, shuts my brain down. All of this came about because there was a new translation of The Iliad, by Robert Fagles, and it was in verse form. The thing is, I couldnt read it. So this woman at a dinner said Dont read it, listen to it. I bought the tape and I listened to it, and I found I was completely enthralled. I was surprised by the fact that the story was orally transmitted 2,800 years ago in a different language to a different culture. It was meant for oral transmission, of course, because it had that rhythm to it. Favorite Lectures from the Teaching Company For several years, Ed listened to Teaching Company lectures every day during his commute Theyve got them on economics, Shakespeare, and so forth. The thing that had the greatest impact on me was the whole suite of world history. . . . Although, I must admit there was one that was around the time of King Henry VIII, the Tudors and the Stuarts. I was so blown away with that that as soon as I listened to it, I listened to it again. To Become an Artist, Learn to See Ed wanted to be an animator in high school and did well in art. Near his freshman year of college, however, he didnt see a path to the level required to be a Disney animator, so he switched to physics. Many people think this is incongruous and unrelated. He disagrees Most people to this day think of them as so radically different from each other. But I want to posit a different way to look at it. It comes from what I think is a fundamental misunderstanding of art on the part of most people. Because they think of art as learning to draw or learning a certain kind of selfexpression. But in fact, what artists do is they learn to see. Meditation Ed practices vipassana meditation for 30 to 60 minutes per day in one session.

It comes from what I think is a fundamental misunderstanding of art on the part of most people. Because they think of art as learning to draw or learning a certain kind of selfexpression. But in fact, what artists do is they learn to see. Meditation Ed practices vipassana meditation for 30 to 60 minutes per day in one session.

When You Complain, Nobody Wants to Help You I was born with spina bifida, which is a congenital birth defect where your vertebrae dont form around your spinal cord. This is likely attributed to my dads exposure to Agent Orange when he was in Vietnam. . . . I did a lot of painting when I was recovering from surgeries, so I had to use interesting techniques, like crawling on the floor to make the painting because I couldnt stand up. As a coping mechanism I tried complaining and being bitter. It didnt work. It was just terrible. . . . Stephen Hawking actually has the best quote on this and also a legitimate story. . . . He has the right to complain probably more than anybody. He says that, When you complain, nobody wants to help you, and its the simplest thing and so plainly spoken. Only he could really say that brutal, honest truth, but its true, right? If you spend your time focusing on the things that are wrong, and thats what you express and project to people you know, you dont become a source of growth for people, you become a source of destruction for people. That draws more destructiveness. Because I was thinking about how I was in pain and talking about how I was in pain, it started a momentum that went in a negative direction in my life. At one point, probably 2006 to 2007, I just decided to put myself on a complaining diet, where I said, Not only am I not going to say anything negative about the situation Im in, but Im not going to let myself think anything negative about it. . . . It took a long time and I wasnt perfect at it, but . . . not only did replacing those thoughts helped me start moving my life in a better direction, where I wasnt obsessing about what was wrong, . . . it also made me not feel physical pain as much, which is very liberating and kind of necessary if you want to do anything. Pick the Right Audience to Suck in Front Of If anybody is going to go out and pitch investors, my advice is to make your first 10 meetings with investors that you dont really want funding from, because youre probably going to suck in the beginning. I sucked for a really long time. TF Even Jerry Seinfeld bombs with early material see the Comedian documentary, so he develops it at small venues. Nike tests a lot of their new products and campaigns in places like New Zealand before getting on the big stage in the United States.

Jeff Bezos on Questioning Assumptions Basically, every time I talk to Bezos Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, it changes my life. . . . For example, Ive spent my entire life thinking that I want to go to Mars . . . it was on The Brady Bunch. I thought this was the best thing ever. At some point, if I structure my life correctly, maybe Ill get to go. I think its just so important for humanity to be able to do that . . . and I talked to Elon Musk a couple of times and was vastly inspired by everything that he and SpaceX are doing. . . . I ran into Jeff Bezos a bit later and was saying I just got to talk with Elon, and Im superexcited about Mars. I really hope that one day I can go. And Bezos looks at me and goes, Mars is stupid. And I say, What? He says, Once we get off of the planet, the last thing we want to do is go to another gravity. Bezos said, The whole point, the reason this is so hard to get off the earth, is to defeat gravity the first time. Once we do that, why would you want to go to Mars? We should just live on space stations and mine asteroids and everything is much better than being on Mars. And in 30 seconds, he had completely changed the course of my life, because hes totally right. Mikitani on Necessary ReinventionThe Rule of 3 and 10 Phil considers Hiroshi Mikitani, the founder and CEO of Rakuten, one of the most impressive people in the world. Almost 90 of Japans Internet population is registered with Rakuten, the countrys largest online marketplace. Mikitani taught Phil the rule of 3 and 10. This effectively means that every single thing in your company breaks every time you roughly triple in size. He was the first employee at Rakuten, and now theyve got 10,000 or more. He said when youre just one person, everything kind of works. You sort of figure it out. And then, at some point, you have three people, and now, things are kind of different. Making decisions and everything with three people is different. But you adjust to that. Then, youre fine for a while. You get to 10 people, and everything kind of breaks again. You figure that out, and then you get to 30 people and everything is different, and then 100 and then 300 and then 1,000. His hypothesis is that everything breaks at roughly these points of 3 and 10 multiples of 3 and powers of 10. And by everything, it means everything how you handle payroll, how you schedule meetings, what kind of communications you use, how you do budgeting, who actually makes decisions. Every implicit and explicit part of the company just changes significantly when it triples. His insight is that a lot of companies get into trouble because of this. When youre a quickly growing startup, you get into huge trouble because you blow right through a few of these triplings without really realizing it. And then, you turn around, and you realize . . . were at 400 people now, but some of our processes and systems we set in place when we were 30. . . . You should constantly, perpetually be thinking about how to reinvent yourself and how to treat the culture. Big companies get in trouble for exactly the opposite reason. Lets say you get to 10,000 people in your company and, theoretically, you figured out how to run things at 10,000. Well, your next big point isnt until 30,000. But youre probably not going to get the 30,000 ever, or certainly not within a few years. It might take a decade or more for a company to go from 10,000 to 30,000. But no one feels like waiting around for a decade or more to reinvent themselves, and so big companies are constantly pushing all of these bullshit innovation initiatives because they feel like they have to do something. But theyre not actually connected to any fundamental change in the company. TF Have you outgrown your systems or beliefs? Is it time that you upgraded?

Chris is the principal coauthor of the genreredefining sixvolume work Modernist Cuisine. Chris was also the founding chef of Heston Blumenthals Fat Duck experimental kitchen, the secret culinary laboratory behind the innovative dishes at one of the best restaurants in the world. Prior to becoming a chef, he completed degrees in theoretical mathematics and biochemistry. He is now the CEO of ChefSteps, based above Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington.

Off hours, Chris is training to break a world record in unpowered gliding. Target location Patagonia. Chris was my goto scientist for the Scientist section of The 4Hour Chef, and several of his recipes led me to a live cooking demo with Jimmy Fallon. Chris is good friends with sciencefiction writer Neal Stephenson, whos penned several of my alltime favorites, including Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon. Many guests in this book recommend both Snow Crash and The Diamond Age Seth Godin, page 237, and Kelly Starrett, page 122. Every year, Chris and Neal have the Annual Loudness Fest in Neals backyard, where they build outrageous machines and cooking contraptions It wasnt a big deal that we dug a 6 x 6 x 6deep pit in his backyard and turned it into a Jacuzzi to sousvide cook a 300pound pig, Chris says. Each year after that for the next 5 years, it had to be more overthetop, more outlandish, more ludicrously dangerous. Dangerous in the sense of maybe the neighbors houses will burn down, maybe somebody will be killed by spilling concrete, maybe somebody will be burned to cinders because were cooking with magma, that kind of thing. What would you put on a billboard? It all worked out anyway, placed outside of his high school. High school was not a great time for me. The interesting jobs are the ones that you make up. His dad, a very successful entrepreneur, gave Chris advice when he was a freshman or sophomore in high school I distinctly remember him saying not to worry about what I was going to do because the job I was going to do hadnt even been invented yet. . . . The interesting jobs are the ones that you make up. Thats something I certainly hope to instill in my son Dont worry about what your job is going to be. . . . Do things that youre interested in, and if you do them really well, youre going to find a way to temper them with some good business opportunity. What interesting thing are you working on? Why is that interesting to you? Whats surprising about that? Is anybody else thinking about this? These are common questions from Heston Blumenthal, the former executive chef of The Fat Duck, the then1 ranked restaurant in the world. Chris explains Ive never seen somebody as curious as him, who could talk to just about anyone else about whatever it was they did. He would pose questions like the above to anyone about anything, whether they were psychologists, sports trainers, chefs, writers, or otherwise. This made me smile. I met Heston once in the early 2000s at a book signing inside a culinary school in San Francisco. I sheepishly approached him and asked, What is your favorite way to cook beans? Im embarrassed to ask, but I have a lot of trouble getting them right. He perked up, looked me straight in the eyes, and said, You know, people dont know how complex beans can be, asked perhaps a dozen clarifying questions, then proceeded to give me a 5minute masters degree in cooking beans. Ive been a fanboy since. If you had 100 million, what would you build that would have no value to others in copying? Gabe Newell, the billionaire cofounder of video game development and distribution company Valve, has largely funded Chriss company ChefSteps. Hes been a huge supporter, but only after asking questions that stretch Chriss brain So Gabe goes, If I gave you 100 million, what would you guys go build? That by building it, theres no value for anyone copying? Ill give you an example. When Intel goes to build a new chip fabricator, its billions and billions of dollars, and theres no value in anybody else copying it, because not only do they have to spend even more billions to catch up, but they have to spend more billions to learn everything else Intel knows about this, and then they have to be 10 times better for anyone to want to switch. So its just a waste of everyones time to attempt copying. TF One of the top 10 venture capitalists I know uses a variant of this'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

Ive been a fanboy since. If you had 100 million, what would you build that would have no value to others in copying? Gabe Newell, the billionaire cofounder of video game development and distribution company Valve, has largely funded Chriss company ChefSteps. Hes been a huge supporter, but only after asking questions that stretch Chriss brain So Gabe goes, If I gave you 100 million, what would you guys go build? That by building it, theres no value for anyone copying? Ill give you an example. When Intel goes to build a new chip fabricator, its billions and billions of dollars, and theres no value in anybody else copying it, because not only do they have to spend even more billions to catch up, but they have to spend more billions to learn everything else Intel knows about this, and then they have to be 10 times better for anyone to want to switch. So its just a waste of everyones time to attempt copying. TF One of the top 10 venture capitalists I know uses a variant of this litmus test as his measurement of disruptive For each 1 of revenue you generate, can you cost an incumbent 5 to 10? If so, hell invest. As a related aside, one of my favorite businessrelated PDFs floating around the Internet is Valve Handbook for New Employees from Gabes company. As Chris put it Its the only HR document you will ever knowingly want to read. The Accidental Jedi Mind Trick Chris got his first line cook job by accidentally appealing to the chefs William Belickiss ego. He had been staging interning and wanted to make the jump to fulltimer At the end of service, William was really gracious. He sat down with me in the dining room, and he had a glass of wine. He offered me a glass. He said, You know, nows probably not really a great time. Im not sure I have the work for you. Being very earnest, I said, I totally understand. Is there anybody in town youd recommend would be a good place for me to work? Im really committed to doing this. I really want to see what its about. And what I didnt realize at the time, was that was probably the perfect thing to have said to William, because William had an enormous ego and he was just not going to be capable of bringing himself to say anybody else in town was any good at all. So you could just see him sort of sputtering. Well, really theres no one. I think Im probably the right person to teach you. So why dont you come back on Tuesday? Hold the Standard Chris mentioned that by the time he arrived at The Fat Duck, Heston no longer yelled at people, but he signaled disappointment in other ways . . . he really pushed you, the team, everyone else to strive for excellence all the time. I asked him to give me an example. Heres his response, shortened for space The order came on for quail jelly, and I saw that they werent fully set up. I tried to float the langoustine cream on top anyway, and I sent them out to the pass knowing that they werent perfect. Those things came back like a boomerang. Heston just came around the corner holding them in his hand and just goes, Chris. Hes looking at me, and hes looking at the dish, and hes looking at me, and hes looking at the dish, and . . . Not a chance. Puts it back. I just remember the withering looklike if I ever did that again, dont show up again. I remember the lesson because he said, We can do something else. If its not ready, were not going to send it out, and just hope they dont notice that its not that good. Well fix it. Well do something else, but dont try to slip by something that you know is below the standard. You only need that lesson once. That wasnt the standard, and you know what the standard is. Hold the standard. Ask for help. Fix it. Do whatevers necessary. But dont cheat. TIM But how do you manage the fine line between insisting on high standards and simply being an overbearing asshole? Chris now manages a company of 50 employees. CHRIS The first thing is, on a good day, I will try to step back and say, What context does this person even have, and have I provided appropriate context? . . . Given all the context they had, maybe I wouldve made the same decision, or I could imagine somebody else making the same decision. So increasingly, I try to think about What context and visibility do I have and what do they have? Am I basically being unfair because Im operating from a greater set of information? The AntiBullshit Manual One of the books that Chris has found himself gifting a lot is an outofprint book on thermodynamics called The Second Law. It was written by an Oxford physical chemistry professor named P.W. Atkins. That book is just a phenomenal, casual, infographicladen read on how the world works from an energy perspective. I found that so incredibly useful in trying to understand how to do something, how to make something work, whether somethings even possible. Its frequently my bullshit detector. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? Chris says his father and Winston Churchill. Of the latter Theres a great series of books, The Last Lion by William Manchester, on Winston Churchill. The third volume actually just came out a few years ago posthumously.

I hit a local club owner up in Utah, and I asked, Whats your worst night that you have? Whats the slowest night? and he said, Monday. Im not even open. I said, Dude, let me come down on Monday night. This is a bar that had opened in the 1940s and had all of its original decor. Its called Club Manhattan. Its an amazing place in the basement. Anyway, the owner says, Ill give you a cut of the door. You have your friends come in, invite some people, and well see what happens. It turned out the night was a smash. I did it for 5 years, and I ended up doing two nights a week. It was Monday, and then I took on a Thursday . . . I was working at a clothing store trying to support myself going to school, and I quit after the first week. . . . It started clicking, and then, when I was making enough money, I started to buy my first studio equipment. Put the Big Stones in First When I can, I travel with my family. Im married and I have three children, so Im always trying to figure out, How can I make this work? You know, putting the stones in the bucket. Whats really important here, and how can I fill the bucket with the things that are really important to me? TF This visual metaphor was first taught to me by a college professor, and its a great way to think about priorities. Paraphrasing my teacher Imagine you have a large glass jar. Next to it, you have a few large rocks, a small pile of marblesized pebbles, and a pile of sand. If you put in the sand or pebbles first, what happens? You cant fit the big rocks in. But if you add the big rocks, then the mediumsized pebbles, and only then the sand, it all fits. In other words, the minutiae fit around the big things, but the big things dont fit around the minutiae.

Catching Cheaters in His Class with Google Traps at Carnegie Mellon There was one problem in an assignment that was called Giramacristos Puzzle. I made that word up beforehand. I made sure there was no such thing on Google. I made a website that had the right solution, but it recorded everybodys IP address. And at CMU you can figure out their dorm from their IP address. So I could figure out which person was actually checking. It turns out, that time, out of the 200 students, about 40 Googled for the answer, and that was fun. I used to do all kinds of things like that. The students were all usually scared of almost everything being a trick. I would just say, If you just confess, you get a 0 on the assignment, and people confess. I would do that in the first one or two assignments, and then afterward, they would learn not to cheat.

The Value of I Dont Understand My PhD advisor at Carnegie Mellon was a guy named Manuel Blum, who many people consider the father of cryptography encryption, etc.. Hes amazing and hes very funny. I learned a lot from him. When I met him, which was like 15 years ago, I guess he was in his 60s, but he always acted way older than he actually was. He just acted as if he forgot everything. . . . I had to explain to him what I was working on, which at the time was CAPTCHA, these distorted characters that you have to type all over the Internet. Its very annoying. That was the thing I was working on later acquired by Google, and I had to explain it to him. It was very funny, because usually I would start explaining something, and in the first sentence he would say, I dont understand what youre saying, and then I would try to find another way of saying it, and a whole hour would pass and I could not get past the first sentence. He would say, Well, the hours over. Lets meet next week. This must have happened for months, and at some point I started thinking, I dont know why people think this guys so smart. Later, I understood what he was doing. This is basically just an act. Essentially, I was being unclear about what I was saying, and I did not fully understand what I was trying to explain to him. He was just drilling deeper and deeper and deeper until I realized, every time, that there was actually something I didnt have clear in my mind. He really taught me to think deeply about things, and I think thats something I have not forgotten. TF This week, try experimenting with saying I dont understand. Can you explain that to me? more often. See Malcolm Gladwells mention of his father on page 573. Building a Startup Outside of Silicon Valley Its pretty amazing how when youre talking to people from Silicon Valley at industry events, it really does seem like the average tenure of a person in one of these startup companies is like a year and half. . . . Whereas for us in Pittsburgh, people really dont leave. Because in terms of startups, were not exactly the only game in townthats unfair to saybut there arent very many games in town. TF Ive had successful exits from founders based in every place from Oklahoma and Colorado Daily Burn to Ottawa, Canada Shopify. From a recruiting standpoint, not only is Shopify one of the major goto tech companies in Eastern Canada, but they also dont have a lot of attrition. People are settled in Ottawa, and theyre not getting poached by Facebook, Google, Uber. These families dont want to move to San Francisco, and Shopify therefore doesnt need to enter a bloodbath of bidding wars. Think youre doomed because youre outside of the epicenter of your industry? See if you can find benefits, as there might be some nonobvious advantages.

One of the roles was that of an anteambuloliterally meaning one who clears the path. An anteambulo proceeded in front of his patron anywhere they traveled in Rome, making way, communicating messages, and generally making the patrons life easier. The famous epigrammist Martial fulfilled this role for many years, serving for a time under the patron Mela, a wealthy businessman and brother of the Stoic philosopher and political advisor Seneca. Born without a rich family, Martial also served under another businessman named Petilius. As a young writer, he spent most of his day traveling from the home of one rich patron to another, providing services, paying his respects, and receiving small token payments and favors in return. Heres the problem Like most of us with our internships and entrylevel positions or later on, publishers or bosses or clients, Martial absolutely hated every minute of it. He seemed to believe that this system somehow made him a slave. Aspiring to live like some country squirelike the patrons he servicedMartial wanted money and an estate that was all his own. There, he dreamed, he could finally produce his works in peace and independence. As a result, his writing often drags with a hatred and bitterness about Romes upper crust, from which he believed he was cruelly shunted. For all his impotent rage, what Martial couldnt see was that it was his unique position as an outsider to society that gave him such fascinating insight into Roman culture that it survives to this day. Instead of being pained by such a system, what if hed been able to come to terms with it? What ifgasphe could have appreciated the opportunities it offered? Nope. It seemed to eat him up inside instead. Its a common attitude that transcends generations and societies. The angry, unappreciated genius is forced to do stuff she doesnt like, for people she doesnt respect, as she makes her way in the world. How dare they force me to grovel like this! The injustice! The waste! We see it in recent lawsuits, in which interns sue their employers for pay. We see kids more willing to live at home with their parents than to submit to something theyre overqualified to work for. We see it in an inability to meet anyone else on their terms, an unwillingness to take a step back in order to potentially take several steps forward. I will not let them get one over on me. Id rather we both have nothing instead. Its worth taking a look at the supposed indignities of serving someone else. Because in reality, not only is the apprentice model responsible for some of the greatest art in the history of the worldeveryone from Michelangelo to Leonardo da Vinci to Benjamin Franklin has been forced to navigate such a systembut if youre going to be the big deal you think you are going to be, isnt this a rather trivial, temporary imposition? When someone gets his first job or joins a new organization, hes often given this advice Make other people look good and you will do well. Keep your head down, they say, and serve your boss. Naturally, this is not what the kid who was chosen over all the other kids for the position wants to hear. Its not what a Harvard grad expectsafter all, they got that degree precisely to avoid this supposed indignity. Lets flip it around so it doesnt seem so demeaning Its not about kissing ass. Its not about making someone look good. Its about providing the support so that others can be good. The better wording for the advice is this Find canvases for other people to paint on. Be an anteambulo. Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself. When you are just starting out, we can be sure of a few fundamental realities 1 Youre not nearly as good or as important as you think you are 2 you have an attitude that needs to be readjusted 3 most of what you think you know or most of what you learned in books or in school is out of date or wrong. Theres one fabulous way to work all of that out of your system Attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful, subsume your identity into theirs, and move both forward simultaneously. Its certainly more glamorous to pursue your own glorythough hardly as effective. Obeisance is the way forward.

When you are just starting out, we can be sure of a few fundamental realities 1 Youre not nearly as good or as important as you think you are 2 you have an attitude that needs to be readjusted 3 most of what you think you know or most of what you learned in books or in school is out of date or wrong. Theres one fabulous way to work all of that out of your system Attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful, subsume your identity into theirs, and move both forward simultaneously. Its certainly more glamorous to pursue your own glorythough hardly as effective. Obeisance is the way forward. Thats the other effect of this attitude It reduces your ego at a critical time in your career, letting you absorb everything you can without the obstructions that block others vision and progress.

Remember that anteambulo means clearing the pathfinding the direction someone already intended to head and helping them pack, freeing them up to focus on their strengths. In fact, making things better rather than simply looking as if you are. Many people know of Benjamin Franklins famous pseudonymous letters written under names like Silence Dogwood. What a clever young prodigy, they think, and miss the most impressive part entirely Franklin wrote those letters, submitted them by sliding them under the printshop door, and received absolutely no credit for them until much later in his life. In fact, it was his brother, the printshop owner, who profited from their immense popularity, regularly running them on the front page of his newspaper. Franklin was playing the long game, thoughlearning how public opinion worked, generating awareness of what he believed in, crafting his style and tone and wit. It was a strategy he used time and again over his careeronce even publishing in his competitors paper in order to undermine a third competitorfor Franklin saw the constant benefit in making other people look good and letting them take credit for your ideas. Bill Belichick, the fourtime Super Bowlwinning head coach of the New England Patriots, made his way up the ranks of the NFL by loving and mastering the one part of the job that coaches disliked at the time analyzing film. His first job in professional football, for the Baltimore Colts, was one he volunteered to take without payand his insights, which provided ammunition and critical strategies for the game, were attributed exclusively to the more senior coaches. He thrived on what was considered grunt work, asked for it, and strove to become the best at precisely what others thought they were too good for. He was like a sponge, taking it all in, listening to everything, one coach said. You gave him an assignment and he disappeared into a room and you didnt see him again until it was done, and then he wanted to do more, said another. As you can guess, Belichick started getting paid very soon. Before that, as a young high school player, he was so knowledgeable about the game that he functioned as a sort of assistant coach even while playing the game. Belichicks father, himself an assistant football coach for Navy, taught him a critical lesson in football politics If he wanted to give his coach feedback or question a decision, he needed to do it in private and selfeffacingly so as not to offend his superior. He learned how to be a rising star without threatening or alienating anyone. In other words, he had mastered the canvas strategy. You can see how easily entitlement and a sense of superiority the trappings of ego would have made the accomplishments of either of these men impossible. Franklin would never have been published if hed prioritized credit over creative expressionindeed, when his brother found out, he literally beat him out of jealousy and anger. Belichick would have pissed off his coach and then probably been benched if he had oneupped him in public. He certainly wouldnt have taken his first job for free, and he wouldnt have sat through thousands of hours of film if he cared about status. Greatness comes from humble beginnings it comes from grunt work. It means youre the least important person in the roomuntil you change that with results. There is an old saying, Say little, do much. What we really ought to do is update and apply a version of that to our early approach. Be lesser, do more. Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them, something you could do for them? And you looked at it in a way that entirely benefited them and not you? The cumulative effect this would have over time would be profound Youd learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. Youd develop a reputation for being indispensable. Youd have countless new relationships. Youd have an enormous bank of favors to call upon down the road. Thats what the canvas strategy is abouthelping yourself by helping others. Making a concerted effort to trade your shortterm gratification for a longerterm payoff. Whereas everyone else wants to get credit and be respected, you can forget credit. You can forget it so hard that youre glad when others get it instead of youthat was your aim, after all. Let the others take their credit on credit, while you defer and earn interest on the principal. The strategy part of it is the hardest. Its easy to be bitter, like Martial. To hate even the thought of subservience. To despise those who have more means, more experience, or more status than you. To tell yourself that every second not spent doing your work, or working on yourself, is a waste of your gift. To insist, I will not be demeaned like this.

Once we fight this emotional and egotistical impulse, the canvas strategy is easy. The iterations are endless. Maybe its coming up with ideas to hand over to your boss. Find people, thinkers, upandcomers to introduce to each other. Cross wires to create new sparks. Find what nobody else wants to do and do it. Find inefficiencies and waste and redundancies. Identify leaks and patches to free up resources for new areas. Produce more than everyone else and give your ideas away. In other words, discover opportunities to promote their creativity, find outlets and people for collaboration, and eliminate distractions that hinder their progress and focus. It is a rewarding and infinitely scalable power strategy. Consider each one an investment in relationships and in your own development. The canvas strategy is there for you at any time. There is no expiration date on it either. Its one of the few that age does not limiton either side, young or old. You can start at any timebefore you have a job, before youre hired and while youre doing something else, or if youre starting something new or find yourself inside an organization without strong allies or support. You may even find that theres no reason to ever stop doing it, even once youve graduated to heading your own projects. Let it become natural and permanent let others apply it to you while youre too busy applying it to those above you. Because if you pick up this mantle once, youll see what most peoples egos prevent them from appreciating The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.

Two of his favorite, easytofind teas are both from Red Blossom Tea Company Tung Ting dark roast oolong, and, for something milder, Silver Needle white tea. He was my guest for episode 1 of The Tim Ferris Show, which didnt have a name at the time. He suggested TIMTIMTALKTALK long story, and tens of thousands of fans still use that nickname on social media. Damn you, KevKev. The worst question I asked him was If you could be a breakfast cereal, what breakfast cereal would you choose and why? We were drinking wine, and things got messy. In 2012, Kevin and his wife, neuroscientist Darya Pino Rose, spent three weeks in Japan with me and my thengirlfriend. One night after dinner, I casually walked up to my ex on the sidewalk and put my hand in her back pocket, right on her ass. Oh, hi, TimTim, Darya said casually. It was her ass.

Gut Investing Kevin is a rare double threat as an investor he is excellent at investing in both earlystage tech Series Seed or A and publiclytraded stocks. Most who are good at one are terrible at the other. When I ask him about either, he often asks me variants of the following questions Do you understand it? Do you think theyll be dominant and growing 3 years from now? Do you think this technology will be more or less a part of our lives in 3 years? Hes made dozens of spectacular investments based on his own answers to these questions, plus an added dimension emotional response. One might dismiss talk of gut with a wave of the hand, but, as they say, once youre lucky, twice youre good. Kevin has replicated his success over and over again. There are many technically complex approaches to investing, covered ad nauseam elsewhere. Here is one alternative perspective with doesnt get as much airplay. Enter Kevin Just before heading out on stage at a tech conference, TechCrunch founder J. Michael Arrington asked me, Youve invested in a lot of great startups, how do you pick your companies? I responded, I trust my gut. He seemed unsatisfied and told me, Youve got to come up with something better than that. Ive always admired the tech investors who construct a big, overarching thesis to frame their investment philosophy. Software is eating the world, the bottomup economy, and investing in thunder lizards, to name a few. This type of theme investing is a great strategy for funds, but it never really applied to me as an individual angel investor. For me, the decision to invest in a startup comes after following a process that is heavily weighted towards EQ emotional quotient. This process starts with exploring the idea emotionally. Should it pass that hurdle, I then do traditional due diligence, using objective data to validate the entrepreneurs assumptions around the quantifiable aspects of the business. So, how does one explore an idea emotionally? When evaluating a new product, I take the novel features not every feature and exhaustively play out how they might impact the emotions of the consumers who use them. After that, I take the same features and consider how they might evolve over time. Lets take, for example, my notes around Twitter which led to my investment in 2008. I was intrigued by a handful of novel features TweetingQuick public sharing. Emotional reaction Typing 140 characters is quicker and easier than starting a blog. The fear and time associated with writing a long post is nonexistent. Updates can be done through text, no computer needed remember, this was before apps. This could be a huge draw for nontechnical celebrities. FollowingA new contrarian concept that allowed users to follow people they didnt know. While this seems commonplace today, at the time it flipped the more popular bidirectional friendship model on its head. Emotional reaction Building a following base feels like a game or competition. Users will encourage their friends and fans to follow, bringing in additional users. This game of bringing in your friends and fans is free marketing for Twitter. Following forces public sharing as default. This gives fans a deeper connection with people they admire but do not know. TF Twitter also used a Top 100 mostfollowed list early on to pour gasoline on competition. Syndication of content. Emotional reaction Users are beginning to use the nomenclature RT to indicate a retweet this was common practice before the official retweet feature was developed. This ad hoc feature allows users to syndicate messages beyond their social graph, giving a users message increased visibility. The realtime nature of Twitter allows news stories to break faster than traditional media even at the time, my startup, Digg. In allowing myself to feel these features through the eyes of the users, I can get a sense of the excitement around them. This type of thinking can also be applied to larger industry trends.

My colleague and friend David Prager was one of the first owners of the Tesla Model S. The second he received the car he graciously allowed all of his friends to testdrive it. What stuck with me most was not the car, but the sound it made. When he dropped me off, he slammed on the acceleration pedal and was whisked up a large San Francisco hill. All I heard was the electric swishhum of acceleration. For me, this was like so many scifi movies I had seen growing upit sounded like the future. A few days later, I remember hearing a large city bus trying to climb the same hill. The diesel engine was rattling and struggling, almost as if it were out of shape, fighting for its next breath. It was clear to me that while consumer adoption would be slow, with technological advances in energy storage only a matter of time, electric vehicles would be the future of this industry. These feelings led to me take a position in the company back when it was largely unfashionable. Ive actually used this framework more to help me steer clear of bad investments than to find good ones. In evaluating my meetings over the last calendar year, I met with an average of 18 companies before I found one worthwhile of investment. Thats a lot of saying no. For example, the current incarnation of virtual reality gear doesnt pass my test. Units are large, clunky, require insanely expensive computers, and setup is a mess. The experience, while fun, isnt an order of magnitude better than traditional gaming. So, as of right now, Ive avoided VR investments. At some point years out, the right mixture of power, size, price, and reality technology will combine into a device that will likely see mass adoption. But as of right now, Im a pass. TF Kevin did call the explosion of augmented reality AR months before Pokmon Go exploded, emphasizing that AR and VR are not the same thing. He was bullish on AR and very bearish on VR. Its important to note Im also a believer in objective data and using it to inform decisions, especially in later rounds of financing. But in the early stage, at the seed of an idea, the bet is largely based on the quality of the team and the emotional connection you feel with the product. Many fellow investors believe the gut shouldnt be trusted, and chalk up success using it to dumb luck. Certainly, creative intuition varies from person to person. There is no magic formula here. But I do believe we can think of gut intuition as a tool that can be called upon when evaluating ideas with very little data, such as startups that have yet to launch.

Dont Accept the Norms of Your Time I was talking with this billionaire friend of mine, and I was saying, Id really like to write a book about the way your mind works. He was commenting on the difference between someone who isnt a billionaire and a billionaire. . . . He said, The biggest mistake you can make is to accept the norms of your time. Not accepting norms is where you innovate, whether its with technology, with books, with anything. So, not accepting the norm is the secret to really big success and changing the world.

TF Neil and I, and many other writers, use TK as a placeholder for things we need to research later e.g., He was TK years old at the time.. This is common practice, as almost no English words have TK in them except that pesky Atkins, making it easy to use ControlF when its time to batchresearch or factcheck. Edit for You, Your Fans, Then Your Haters Neil edits his writing in three phases. Paraphrased First, I edit for me. What do I like? Second, I edit for my fans. What would be most enjoyable and helpful to my fans? Third, I edit for my haters. What would my detractors try and pick apart, discredit, or make fun of? Neil elaborates on the last I always use Eminem as an example. You cant really criticize Eminem, because in his songs he impersonates the critics and then answers them. . . . Theres nothing that people have said about him that isnt already answered or accomplished in some selfaware way. So, I really want to answer the criticstheir questions, their critiquesin a way that is still fun and entertaining. Thats the idea of haterproofing it. TF Haterproofing can take many forms, whether making fun of yourself I know this is laughably contradictory, but . . . or bringing up a likely criticism and addressing it head on e.g., Some people might understandably say . . . criticism.. Seneca does a fantastic job of the latter in The Moral Letters of Lucilius, and Scott Adams page 261 used a similar technique in his novel Gods Debris. Writers block does not actually exist. . . . Writers block is almost like the equivalent of impotence. Its performance pressure you put on yourself that keeps you from doing something you naturally should be able to do. Writers Block Is like Impotence This is a common refrain from seasoned journalists. Whether its ideas see James Altucher, page 246 or writing, the key is temporarily dropping your standards. One of the best pieces of advice Ive received for writing was a mantra Two crappy pages per day. A more experienced author related it back to IBM, who was the 800pound gorilla across several different industries a few decades ago. Their salespeople were known for being incredibly effective and smashing records. How did IBM develop that? In some ways, by doing the opposite of what youd expect. For instance, IBM made the quotas really low. They wanted the salespeople to not be intimidated to pick up the phone. They wanted the salespeople to build momentum and then overshoot their quotas and goals. This is exactly what happened. Translated to writing, I was told my goal should be two crappy pages a day. Thats it. If you hit two crappy pages, even if you never use them, you can feel successful for the day. Sometimes you barely eke out two pages, and they are truly terrible. But at least 50 of the time, youll produce perhaps 5, 10, or evenon the rare miracle day20 pages. Draft ugly and edit pretty. Be Vulnerable to Get Vulnerability Neil is a seasoned interviewer and taught me a golden key early on Open up and be vulnerable with the person youre going to interview before you start. It works incredibly well. Prior to hitting record, Ill take 5 to 10 minutes for banter, warmup, sound check, etc. At some point, Ill volunteer personal or vulnerable information e.g., how Ive hated being misquoted in the past, and I know the feeling how Im struggling with a deadline based on external pressures, etc.. This makes them much more inclined to do the same later. Sometimes, Ill instead genuinely ask for advice but not interrupt things, along the lines of Youre so good at X, and Im really struggling with Y. I want to respect your time and do this interview, of course, but someday Id love to ask you about that. Listeners often ask me, How do you build rapport so quickly? The above is part one. Part two, I preemptively address common concerns during those 5 to 10 minutes. Ive been fucked by media in the past, and I want my guests to know A I know how terrible that is and B my interview is a safe space in which to be open and experiment. Among other points that I cover This isnt a gotcha show, and its intended to make them look good. I ask, Lets flash forward to a week or month after this interview comes out. What would make it a home run for you? What does successful look like? I ask, Is there anything youd prefer not to talk about?

Its just realizing that everybodys got their own agenda. Even a music magazine is not interviewing you because they love music, right? Their day to day is We need ad dollars, we need clickthrough. . . . If you have a 40word sentence that chops down to 7, and its really titillating, it doesnt matter if it has nothing to do with anything you said in your interview. Its just clickbait, but theyll absolutely go for that because thats what their business is built on. TF The moral of the story is, whenever possible, do printtext interviews via email. A paper trail will give you evidence and recourse if people misbehave. But what if you cant keep it to the inbox? What if you cant or dont want to dodge phone calls? My approach has evolved over the years, but it now checks two boxes avoiding the pain of wasted time, and not getting misquoted or misrepresented. The pain is blocking out 1 to 3 hours for a print piece interview, but ending up with a single sentence as a quote. The remaining 99 of the QA never sees the light of day. Even if the journalist records the call a step in the right direction, Ive never been able to use their audio, as they have a boss who has a boss who has a boss. This situation burns time and makes me sad. So how to fix? Easy, you record it on your sidewhich doubles as a way to cover your ass and combat any malicious intentby saying, Great to connect! What I usually do for phoners is record it on my side as a backup via Skype using Ecamm Call Recorder Zencastr also works well and then email you a Dropbox link afterward. I assume thats cool? If they agree, then youre not breaking the law by recording, and everything is hunkydory. If they dont agree, thats a red flag and you should abort. Missing any one media opportunity wont kill you, but a terrible misquote can persist like an incurable disease. These days, I typically broach the I might want to put the full audio on my podcast after your piece runs, which Ive done before. I assume thats cool? before I agree to interviews. Trading 2 hours dont forget email followups, factchecking, etc. for a potential oneline mention in any text piece isnt otherwise worth it. But when the trade works . . . it can be beautiful.

One of my most popular inbetweenisodes for the podcast was with journalist and hilarious satire writer Joel Stein of Time TW thejoelstein, who killed. It was great for both of us. What Are Their Incentives? Its always smart, before starting any collaboration, to ask yourself, What are their incentives and the timelines of their incentives? How do they measure success? Are we aligned? Dont make shortterm allornothing bets on gimmicks, if youre playing the long game. There will often be pressure from people who are thinking about a promotion next quarter, not your career in 1 to 10 years. Mike shared a story about advice Linkin Park got from their label in the very beginning And they tell us things like, Well, you guys need a gimmick. We want to dress Joe in a lab coat and a cowboy hat. And Chester, you should kick a shoe off at every show. It was stupid recordcompany stuff that sounds like something out of a movie like This Is Spinal Tap. But it was absolutely true, and these were real suggestions. I imagine that if you reminded them now theyd say, Oh, no, I was totally joking. I assure you they were not joking. The band agreed amongst themselves to stick to their guns, and they offered their label two choices shelve us, or let us do what we know how to do. It worked. Ive missed many great financial opportunities predicated on gimmicks. As Thomas Huxley famously said, It is far better for a man to go wrong in freedom than to go right in chains. If youre good, youll have more than one chance. Short and Sweet Littleknown fact Were both huge fans of Hayao Miyazaki animated films. In fact, Princess Mononoke was one of the main inspirations behind Linkin Parks video for In the End. And since you asked, my favorite museum in the world is the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo, created in the Mitaka Forest by Miyazaki. Lesserknown bands Mike introduced me to Royal Blood I like Figure It Out and use it for writing. Doomriders Come Alive is for headbangers and reminiscent of Danzig. Best suited for workouts or piatasmashing. Both Mike and Justin Boreta of The Glitch Mob page 356 use Ableton Live for editing Boreta uses Universal Audio plugins to emulate all of the outboard gear that you could buy. Ira Glass of This American Life also uses Ableton for live performances. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? Mike thought of Rick Rubin page 502, not only for songwriting and producing, but also for life lessons.

TF The question I ask whenever Im straining for extended periods is, What would this look like if it were easy? What is the worst advice you see or hear given in your trade or area of expertise? Theres a lot of bad advice thrown around about getting inspired and searching for a revelation. Like Chuck Close says, Inspiration is for amateursthe rest of us just show up and get to work. And the belief that things will grow out of the activity itself and that you willthrough workbump into other possibilities and kick open other doors that you would never have dreamt of if you were just sitting around looking for a great art idea. If you could give your 20yearold self one piece of advice, what would it be? Chill out. Calm down. I feel like myself and other people I know that are in their early to mid20s get really wound up about things having to be a certain way. It doesnt matter as much as you think it does. TIM Yeah, thats the truth. Will you remember this in 10 years? Probably not. JUSTIN No. People dont even remember a tweet 12 minutes later. Short and Sweet What are three people or sources youve learned fromor followed closelyin the last year? Nautilus magazine, Brain Pickings, Esther Perel. What is the best or most worthwhile investment youve ever made? After being laid off from my job, I decided to switch paths and dive into music headfirst. I maxed out a credit card to buy my first pair of pro studio monitors speakers Genelec 8040A. Monitors are arguably the most important studio purchase you will make. I still use this same pair today. Podcast recommendation Radiolab In The Dust of This Planet The episode explores why a littleknown academic treatise suddenly ended up appearing in pop culture in True Detective and fashion magazines, on one of Jay Zs jackets, etc.. Morning routine Every morning, Justin does 20 minutes of Transcendental Meditation followed by outdoor kettlebell swings with 24 kg 53 lbs. I do exactly the same thing 2 to 3 times per week, aiming for 50 to 75 repetitions of twohanded swings per The 4Hour Body. Music for sleep Justin listens to Max Richters From Sleep, a composed album with a shortened version on Spotify. I put it on very quietly as I am starting my bedtime routine, so it usually ends 15 to 20 minutes after Im asleep. Or I will use the Sonos sleep timer, if Im at home. It started to have this Pavlovian knockout effect after a while, if I use it every day, like a lullaby. If thats too much melody, theres an artist called Mute Button that has highquality, longfield recordings. The gentle rain sounds plus sleep timer are fantastic. I find it great to drown out hotel sounds when traveling. Spirit animal Polar bear Scott Belsky Scott Belsky TW scottbelsky, scottbelsky.com is an entrepreneur, author, and investor.

As an entrepreneur and investor, I am surrounded by people who try to categorize and generalize the factors that make a company successful. . . . Most people forget that innovation and investing in innovation is a business of exceptions. Its easy to understand why most investors rely on pattern recognition. It starts with a successful company that surprises everyone with a new model. Perhaps it is Uber and ondemand networks, Airbnb and the sharing economy, or Warby Parker and vertically integrated ecommerce. What follows is endless analysis and the mass adoption of a playbook that has already been played. . . . Sure, those companies may create a successful derivative, but they wont change the world. I try to learn from the past without being inspired by it. My big question is always, What did they try, and why did it work? When I hear stories of success and failure, I look for the little things that made a big difference. What conventional wisdom was shunned? . . . I avoid using a past success as a proxy for the future. After all, the dirty little secret is that every success was almost a failure. Timing and uncontrollable circumstances play more of a role than any of us care to admit. Perhaps the greatest lesson from the past is how important it is to be inspired by things that surprise us. When I come across a quirky business model in an unpopular space, I try to find a fascinating thread worth pulling. I challenge myself to stop comparing what I learn to the past. If you only look for patterns of the past, you wont venture far. Advice to your 30yearold self? In the wrong environment, your creativity is compromised. At 30, I assumed my strengths would always be with me regardless of where I applied them. I was wrong. Truth is, your environment matters. What would you put on a billboard? Its not about ideas, its about making ideas happen. Id put it on every college campus in the world. In our youth, we are wonderfully creative and idealistic. . . . Truth is, young creative minds dont need more ideas, they need to take more responsibility with the ideas theyve already got. Spirit animal Hermit crab How to Earn Your Freedom In thinking of wealth, its easy to obsess over accumulation. This is natural, but its not always helpful. Oftentimes, finances arent the primary constraint holding us back. Starting in 2004, I traveled the world for roughly 18 months. The lessons learned formed the basis for much of my first book, The 4Hour Workweek. On my journeyfrom the back alleys of Berlin to the hidden lakes of PatagoniaI had next to nothing one backpack and one tiny suitcase. I took only two books with me. One was Walden by Henry David Thoreau naturally, and the other was Vagabonding An Uncommon Guide to the Art of LongTerm World Travel by Rolf Potts TW rolfpotts, rolfpotts.com. I penciled a list of dream destinations on the inside cover of Vagabonding when I first bought it, including places like Stockholm, Prague, Paris, Munich, Berlin, and Amsterdam. The list went on. Using Rolfs roadmap and tips, I checked them all off. I was able to explore many of them for 2 to 3 months at a time at my own pace, unrushed and unworried. It was a dream come true. Reading it over and over again during my travels, I realized Travel isnt just for changing whats outside, its for reinventing whats inside.

The thing is, most Americans probably wouldnt find this movie scene odd. For some reason, we see longterm travel to faraway lands as a recurring dream or an exotic temptation, but not something that applies to the here and now. Insteadout of our insane duty to fear, fashion, and monthly payments on things we dont really needwe quarantine our travels to short, frenzied bursts. In this way, as we throw our wealth at an abstract notion called lifestyle, travel becomes just another accessorya smoothedged, encapsulated experience that we purchase in the same way we buy clothing and furniture. Not long ago, I read that nearly 250,000 shortterm monastery and conventbased vacations had been booked and sold by tour agents the previous year. Spiritual enclaves from Greece to Tibet were turning into hot tourist draws, and travel pundits attributed this solace boom to the fact that busy overachievers are seeking a simpler life. What nobody bothered to point out, of course, is that purchasing a package vacation to find a simpler life is kind of like using a mirror to see what you look like when you arent looking into the mirror. All that is really sold is the romantic notion of a simpler life, andjust as no amount of turning your head or flicking your eyes will allow you to unselfconsciously see yourself in the lookingglassno combination of 1week or 10day vacations will truly take you away from the life you lead at home. Ultimately, this shotgun wedding of time and money has a way of keeping us in a holding pattern. The more we associate experience with cash value, the more we think that money is what we need to live. And the more we associate money with life, the more we convince ourselves that were too poor to buy our freedom. With this kind of mindset, its no wonder so many Americans think extended overseas travel is the exclusive realm of students, counterculture dropouts, and the idle rich. In reality, longterm travel has nothing to do with demographicsage, ideology, incomeand everything to do with personal outlook. Longterm travel isnt about being a college studentits about being a student of daily life. Longterm travel isnt an act of rebellion against societyits an act of common sense within society. Longterm travel doesnt require a massive bundle of cash it requires only that we walk through the world in a more deliberate way. This deliberate way of walking through the world has always been intrinsic to a timehonored, quietly available travel tradition known as vagabonding. Vagabonding involves taking an extended timeout from your normal life6 weeks, 4 months, 2 yearsto travel the world on your own terms. But beyond travel, vagabonding is an outlook on life. Vagabonding is about using the prosperity and possibility of the information age to increase your personal options instead of your personal possessions. Vagabonding is about looking for adventure in normal life, and normal life within adventure. Vagabonding is an attitudea friendly interest in people, places, and things that makes a person an explorer in the truest, most vivid sense of the word. Vagabonding is not a lifestyle, nor is it a trend. Its just an uncommon way of looking at lifea value adjustment from which action naturally follows. And, as much as anything, vagabonding is about timeour only real commodityand how we choose to use it. Sierra Club founder John Muir an urvagabonder if there ever was one used to express amazement at the wellheeled travelers who would visit Yosemite only to rush away after a few hours of sightseeing. Muir called these folks the timepoorpeople who were so obsessed with tending their material wealth and social standing that they couldnt spare the time to truly experience the splendor of Californias Sierra wilderness. One of Muirs Yosemite visitors in the summer of 1871 was Ralph Waldo Emerson, who gushed upon seeing the sequoias, Its a wonder that we can see these trees and not wonder more. When Emerson scurried off a couple hours later, however, Muir speculated wryly about whether the famous transcendentalist had really seen the trees in the first place. Nearly a century later, naturalist Edwin Way Teale used Muirs example to lament the frenetic pace of modern society. Freedom as John Muir knew it, he wrote in his 1956 book Autumn Across America, with its wealth of time, its unregimented days, its latitude of choice . . . such freedom seems more rare, more difficult to attain, more remote with each new generation. But Teales lament for the deterioration of personal freedom was just as hollow a generalization in 1956 as it is now. As John Muir was well aware, vagabonding has never been regulated by the fickle public definition of lifestyle. Rather, it has always been a private choice within a society that is constantly urging us to do otherwise.

As John Muir was well aware, vagabonding has never been regulated by the fickle public definition of lifestyle. Rather, it has always been a private choice within a society that is constantly urging us to do otherwise. Theres a story that comes from the tradition of the Desert Fathers, an order of Christian monks who lived in the wastelands of Egypt about 1,700 years ago. In the tale, a couple of monks named Theodore and Lucius shared the acute desire to go out and see the world. Since theyd made vows of contemplation, however, this was not something they were allowed to do. So, to satiate their wanderlust, Theodore and Lucius learned to mock their temptations by relegating their travels to the future. When the summertime came, they said to each other, We will leave in the winter. When the winter came, they said, We will leave in the summer. They went on like this for over 50 years, never once leaving the monastery or breaking their vows. Most of us, of course, have never taken such vowsbut we choose to live like monks anyway, rooting ourselves to a home or a career and using the future as a kind of phony ritual that justifies the present. In this way, we end up spending as Thoreau put it the best part of ones life earning money in order to enjoy a questionable liberty during the least valuable part of it. Wed love to drop all and explore the world outside, we tell ourselves, but the time never seems right. Thus, given an unlimited amount of choices, we make none. Settling into our lives, we get so obsessed with holding on to our domestic certainties that we forget why we desired them in the first place. Vagabonding is about gaining the courage to loosen your grip on the socalled certainties of this world. Vagabonding is about refusing to exile travel to some other, seemingly more appropriate time of your life. Vagabonding is about taking control of your circumstances instead of passively waiting for them to decide your fate. Thus, the question of how and when to start vagabonding is not really a question at all. Vagabonding starts now. Even if the practical reality of travel is still months or years away, vagabonding begins the moment you stop making excuses, start saving money, and begin to look at maps with the narcotic tingle of possibility. From here, the reality of vagabonding comes into sharper focus as you adjust your worldview and begin to embrace the exhilarating uncertainty that true travel promises. In this way, vagabonding is not a merely a ritual of getting immunizations and packing suitcases. Rather, its the ongoing practice of looking and learning, of facing fears and altering habits, of cultivating a new fascination in people and places. This attitude is not something you can pick up at the airport counter with your boarding pass its a process that starts at home. Its a process by which you first test the waters that will pull you to wonderful new places. Earning your freedom, of course, involves workand work is intrinsic to vagabonding for psychic reasons as much as financial ones. To see the psychic importance of work, one need look no further than people who travel the world on family money. Sometimes referred to as trustafarians, these folks are among the most visible and least happy wanderers in the travel milieu. Draping themselves in local fashions, they flit from one exotic travel scene to another, compulsively volunteering in local political causes, experimenting with exotic intoxicants, and dabbling in every nonWestern religion imaginable. Talk to them, and theyll tell you theyre searching for something meaningful. What theyre really looking for, however, is the reason why they started traveling in the first place. Because they never worked for their freedom, their travel experiences have no personal referenceno connection to the rest of their lives. They are spending plenty of time and money on the road, but they never spent enough of themselves to begin with. Thus, their experience of travel has a diminished sense of value. Thoreau touched on this same notion in Walden. Which would have advanced the most at the end of a month, he posited, the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for thisor the boy who had . . . received a Rodgers penknife from his father? Which would be most likely to cut his fingers? At a certain level, the idea that freedom is tied to labor might seem a bit depressing. It shouldnt be. For all the amazing experiences that await you in distant lands, the meaningful part of travel always starts at home, with a personal investment in the wonders to come. On a practical level, there are countless ways to earn your travels. On the road, I have met vagabonders of all ages, from all backgrounds, and walks of life. Ive met secretaries, bankers, and policemen whove quit their jobs and are taking a peripatetic pause before starting something new.'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

Which would have advanced the most at the end of a month, he posited, the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for thisor the boy who had . . . received a Rodgers penknife from his father? Which would be most likely to cut his fingers? At a certain level, the idea that freedom is tied to labor might seem a bit depressing. It shouldnt be. For all the amazing experiences that await you in distant lands, the meaningful part of travel always starts at home, with a personal investment in the wonders to come. On a practical level, there are countless ways to earn your travels. On the road, I have met vagabonders of all ages, from all backgrounds, and walks of life. Ive met secretaries, bankers, and policemen whove quit their jobs and are taking a peripatetic pause before starting something new. Ive met lawyers, stockbrokers, and social workers who have negotiated months off as they take their careers to new locations. Ive met talented specialistswaiters, web designers, stripperswho find they can fund months of travel on a few weeks of work. Ive met musicians, truck drivers, and employment counselors who are taking extended time off between gigs. Ive met semiretired soldiers and engineers and businessmen whove reserved a year or two for travel before dabbling in something else. Some of the most prolific vagabonders Ive met are seasonal workerscarpenters, park service workers, commercial fishermenwho winter every year in warm and exotic parts of the world. Other folksteachers, doctors, bartenders, journalistshave opted to take their very careers on the road, alternating work and travel as they see fit. Before I got into writing, a whole slew of antisabbaticals landscaping, retail sales, temp work earned me my vagabonding time. I dont like work, says Marlow in Joseph Conrads Heart of Darkness, but I like what is in the workthe chance to find yourself. Marlow wasnt referring to vagabonding, but the notion still applies. Work is not just an activity that generates funds and creates desire Its the vagabonding gestation period, wherein you earn your integrity, start making plans, and get your proverbial act together. Work is a time to dream about travel and write notes to yourself, but its also the time tie up your loose ends. Work is when you confront the problems you might otherwise be tempted to run away from. Work is how you settle your financial and emotional debtsso that your travels are not an escape from your real life, but a discovery of your real life. Now, some of you might think, That sounds fantastic, but I only get 2 weeks of vacation time per year. The good news is, as citizens of a stable, prosperous democracy, any one of us has the power to create our own free time. To actualize this power, we merely need to make strategic use if only for a few weeks for months of a timehonored personal freedom technique, popularly known as quitting. And, despite its pejorative implication, quitting need not be as reckless as it sounds. Many people are able to create vagabonding time through constructive quittingthat is, negotiating with their employers for special sabbaticals and longterm leaves of absence. And even leaving your job in a more permanent manner need not be a negative actespecially in an age when work is likely to be defined by job specialization and the fragmentation of tasks. Whereas working a job with the intention of quitting might have been an act of recklessness 100 years ago, it is more and more often becoming an act of common sense in an age of portable skills and diversified employment options. Keeping this in mind, dont worry that your extended travels might leave you with a gap on your rsum. Rather, you should enthusiastically and unapologetically include your vagabonding experience on your rsum when you return. List the job skills travel has taught you independence, flexibility, negotiation, planning, boldness, selfsufficiency, improvisation. Speak frankly and confidently about your travel experiencesodds are, your next employer will be interested and impressed and a wee bit envious. As Pico Iyer pointed out, the act of quitting means not giving up, but moving on changing direction not because something doesnt agree with you, but because you dont agree with something. Its not a complaint, in other words, but a positive choice, and not a stop in ones journey, but a step in a better direction. Quittingwhether a job or a habitmeans taking a turn so as to be sure youre still moving in the direction of your dreams. In this way, quitting should never be seen as the end of something grudging and unpleasant. Rather, its a vital step in beginning something new and wonderful.

He is the author of books including Bold and Abundance, which have endorsements from Bill Clinton, Eric Schmidt, and Ray Kurzweil, among others. Behind the Scenes Ive heard more power players describe Peter as a force of nature than any other person, except for Tony Robbins, a friend of Peters. Peter is one of those guys who, every time you meet them, leave you shaking your head and productively asking, What the fuck am I doing with my life?! He recently asked me, Whats your moonshot? leading me to reexplore many of the questions and concepts in this profile. A problem is a terrible thing to waste. This is highly related to the scratch your own itch thread that pops up throughout this book. Peter expands I think of problems as gold mines. The worlds biggest problems are the worlds biggest business opportunities. When 99 of people doubt you, youre either gravely wrong or about to make history. I saw this the other day, and this comes from Scott Belsky page 359, who was a founder of Behance. The best way to become a billionaire is to help a billion people. Peter cofounded Singularity University with Ray Kurzweil. In 2008, at their founding conference at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, Google cofounder Larry Page spoke. Among other things, he underscored how he assesses projects I now have a very simple metric I use Are you working on something that can change the world? Yes or no? The answer for 99.99999 of people is no. I think we need to be training people on how to change the world. Origins of the XPRIZE and SuperCredibility The fact of the matter is I read this book, The Spirit of St. Louis, that my good friend Gregg Maryniak gave me . . . and then I thought, Hey, if I can create a prize Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic to win a prize, maybe I can motivate teams to build private spaceships and thats the means to get my ass into space. I start noodling on this as Im reading the book. 10 million bucks is enough money. Im going to call it the XPRIZE because I had no idea who was going to put up the 10 million. The X was going to represent the name of the person who would eventually put up the money, as a variable to be replaced. So, Im scrambling for it back then, 100 here, 1,000 there, getting the seed money to get this going. I end up in St. Louis where an amazing man, Al Kerth, says, I will help you raise some seed money, and he was driven and connected with my passion, my commitment to this. Long story short, over the course of a year and a lot of worn out kneepads, I end up raising a half a million dollars in 10K and 20K checks, and then our fundraising stalls. We make the very bold decision that were going to announce this 10 million prize anyway with no money in place . . . and how you announce a big bold idea to the world really matters. . . . We all have a line of credibility around ideas. We judge them constantly. If you announce it below the line of credibility, people dismiss it out of hand, and then we have this line of supercredibility. If you announce it above the line of supercredibility, people say, Wow, whens it going to happen? How can I be involved? So, its May of 1996. I have half a million dollars. I decide to spend all of it on this launch event, and we do it under the Arch of St. Louis. On the dais, I dont have one astronaut, Ive got 20 astronauts standing on stage with me. Ive got the head of NASA, the head of the FAA, and the Lindbergh family with me onstage announcing this 10 million prize. Did I have any money? No. Did I have any teams registered to compete? No. But around the world, it was frontpage news this 10 million prize was on. . . . Im thinking, Who wouldnt want to pay 10 million after a person did it? Its paid only on success. The challenge is, 150 CEOs later, over the next 5 years between 1996 and 2001, everyones turning me down. I finally meet the Ansari family. Theres a lot more detail here. Listen, the fact of the matter is there were many times at 3 a.m. when I was tempted to give up, and it was only because I was being driven by my own massively transformative purpose that kept me going, and were here today having this conversation because I did not give up. Ill leave it at that. TIM I love that'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

PETER I burned my ships, dude. TIM Who was the hardest person to convince to be on that stage with you? PETER Oh, the head of NASA, for sure. TIM What was the pitch? How did you convince him? PETER The pitch was, Listen, wouldnt you want entrepreneurs around the world to be working on new technologies so that this is off your balance sheet? TF Peter is a master pitchman. Ive seen some greats, and hes right at the top. One of the books he recommends for cultivating dealmaking ability is actually a childrens book and a 10minute read Stone Soup. Its a childrens story that is the best MBA degree you can read. Between the concept of supercredibility and Stone Soup, you have a great foundation. If youre an entrepreneur in college or 60 years old and building your 20th company, Stone Soup is so critically important. Morning Routines Peter stretches during his morning shower Its mostly my lower body, and then Ill go through a breathing exercise as well, and an affirmational mantra. . . . The breathing exercise is an accelerated deep breathing just to oxygenate and stretch my lungs. There are two elements that tie very much to human longevity. Its strange. . . . One is those people who floss and, second, those people who have a higher VO2 max. TF Peters breathing exercise focuses on expanding the lungs with fast, large inhales. His affirmational mantra, which he repeats a number of times, is I am joy. I am love. I am gratitude. I see, hear, feel, and know that the purpose of my life is to inspire and guide the transformation of humanity on and off the Earth. Peters breathing is similar to some of Wim Hofs exercises page 41, which I now do in a cold shower state priming per Tony Robbins, page 210, right after my morning meditation. As for the flossinglongevity connection, Peter is the first to admit this might be correlation instead of causation People anal retentive enough to floss regularly probably have other habits that directly contribute to longer life. PreBed Routines Before bed, Peter always reviews his three wins of the day. This is analogous to the 5Minute Journal p.m. review that I do page 146. On Getting out of Funks TIM To get out of that 2day funk after one of his early startups failed, what does the selftalk look like? I mean, what is the ritual that you use? PETER The selftalk, in all honesty, was probably more like 2 weeks than 2 days. Its going back to Why do I believe this is important? Its, Look how far Ive taken it so far. Its a matter of reminding yourself what your purpose in life is, right? What youre here for. If you havent connected with what your purpose and mission in life is, then forget anything Ive said. That is the numberone thing you need to do Find out what you need to be doing on this planet, why you were put here, and what wakes you up in the mornings. How to Find Your Driving Purpose or Mission Peter recommends Tony Robbinss Date with Destiny program, which he feels helps people improve their operating system. This is how he developed his affirmational mantra. Peter also poses the following three questions What did you want to do when you were a child, before anybody told you what you were supposed to do? What was it you wanted to become? What did you want to do more than anything else? If Peter Diamandis or Tim Ferriss gave you 1 billion, how would you spend it besides the parties and the Ferraris and so forth? If I asked you to spend 1 billion improving the world, solving a problem, what would you pursue? Where can you put yourself into an environment that gives maximum exposure to new ideas, problems, and people? Exposure to things that capture your shower time those things you cant stop thinking about in the shower? Peter recommends environments like Singularity University. TF Still struggling with a sense of purpose or mission? Roughly half a dozen people in this book e.g., Robert Rodriguez have suggested the book Start with Why by Simon Sinek. The Benefits of Thinking 10x Versus 10 I interviewed Astro Teller for my book Bold. Astro is the head of Google X now called X, Google skunkworks. . . .

What was it you wanted to become? What did you want to do more than anything else? If Peter Diamandis or Tim Ferriss gave you 1 billion, how would you spend it besides the parties and the Ferraris and so forth? If I asked you to spend 1 billion improving the world, solving a problem, what would you pursue? Where can you put yourself into an environment that gives maximum exposure to new ideas, problems, and people? Exposure to things that capture your shower time those things you cant stop thinking about in the shower? Peter recommends environments like Singularity University. TF Still struggling with a sense of purpose or mission? Roughly half a dozen people in this book e.g., Robert Rodriguez have suggested the book Start with Why by Simon Sinek. The Benefits of Thinking 10x Versus 10 I interviewed Astro Teller for my book Bold. Astro is the head of Google X now called X, Google skunkworks. . . . He says, When you go after a moonshotsomething thats 10 times bigger, not 10 biggera number of things happen. . . . First of all, when youre going 10 bigger, youre competing against everybody. Everybodys trying to go 10 bigger. When youre trying to go 10 times bigger, youre there by yourself. For me, take asteroid mining as an example. I dont have a lot of asteroid mining competition out there, or prospecting. Or take human longevity, trying to add 40 years in healthy lifespan with HLI. There are not a lot of companies out there attempting this. The second thing is, when you are trying to go 10 times bigger, you have to start with a clean sheet of paper, and you approach the problem completely differently. Ill give you my favorite example Tesla. How did Elon start Tesla and build from scratch the safest, most extraordinary car, not even in America, but I think in the world? Its by not having a legacy from the past to drag into the present. Thats important. The third thing is when you try to go 10 times bigger versus 10 bigger, its typically not 100 times harder, but the reward is 100 times more. More Excellent Questions from Peter One of the questions is Is there a grand challenge or a billionperson problem that you can focus on? Three to five billion new consumers are coming online in the next 6 years. Holy cow, thats extraordinary. What do they need? What could you provide for them, because they represent tens of trillions of dollars coming into the global economy, and they also represent an amazing resource of innovation. So I think about that a lot, and I ask that. The other question I ask is, How would you disrupt yourself? One of the most fundamental realizations is that every entrepreneur, every business, every company will get disrupted. Ive had the honor of talking with Jeff Immelt, the CEO of GE, in his leadership team meetings. The same thing for Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of CocaCola, and for Cisco and for many companies. I ask them, How will you disrupt yourself, and how are you trying to disrupt yourself? If youre not, youre in for a real surprise. Find the smartest 20somethings in your company. I dont care if theyre in the mail room or where they are. Give them permission to figure out how they would take down your company. Peters Laws Peter has a set of rules that guide his life. His 28 Peters Laws have been collected over decades. Here are some of my favorites Law 2 When given a choice . . . take both. Law 3 Multiple projects lead to multiple successes. Law 6 When forced to compromise, ask for more. Law 7 If you cant win, change the rules. Law 8 If you cant change the rules, then ignore them. Law 11 No simply means begin again at one level higher. Law 13 When in doubt THINK. Law 16 The faster you move, the slower time passes, the longer you live.

Novak TW bjnovak, li.st is best known for his work on NBCs Emmy Awardwinning comedy series The Office as an actor, writer, director, and executive producer. He has appeared in films such as Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds and Disneys Saving Mr. Banks. He is the author of the acclaimed short story collection One More Thing and the 1 New York Times bestseller The Book with No Pictures, which has more than 1 million copies in print. Last but not least, he is cofounder of li.st, a new way to create and discover lists about anything and everything. Any time Im telling myself, But Im making so much money, thats a warning sign that Im doing the wrong thing. Looking back at his career, B.J. noticed that he could have stalled in a number of places. Instead, he became very well known for The Office and other megasuccesses. How did he repeatedly choose the right fork in the road? He attributes a lot of it to heeding the above rule of thumb. If you find yourself saying, But Im making so much money about a job or project, pay attention. But Im making so much money, or But Im making good money is a warning sign that youre probably not on the right track or, at least, that you shouldnt stay there for long. Money can always be regenerated. Time and reputation cannot. Getting VIPs When Youre a Nobody One of B.J.s extracurricular activities as a Harvard undergrad was putting on a show called The B.J. Show with another kid conveniently named B.J. During their senior year, the two B.J.s decided to put on a show, and thought to invite Bob Saget to perform. Theyd heard that the wholesome Full House star was, in fact, a really filthy standup comic. But how could two noname kids get a massive celebrity to come for free? B.J. Novak henceforth B.J. came up with two ideas. The first was to honor Bob at the Harvard Lampoon, hoping that he would agree to perform in order to receive an award. The second part of the pitch was that all the proceeds of the show would go to charity. This approach was so successful that B.J. used it repeatedly later in life When possible, always give the money to charity, as it allows you to interact with people well above your pay grade. B.J. coldcalled Sagets management, pitched all this, and it worked like a charm. He talked to Sagets manager who later became B.J.s manager. Saget came to Boston with Jonathan Katz, the creator of Raising Dad their new show at the time, they liked B.J.s edgy writing style, and they offered him a job on their staff. Get the LongTerm goal on the Calendar Before the ShortTerm Pain Hits The first time B.J. tried standup comedy at an openmic night in L.A., it was a disaster. It took him 3 months to work up the courage to get back on stage. B.J. advises firsttime comics to book their first week of shows open mic commitments in advance, so they cant quit after the first performance. He learned that you cant make each night a referendum on whether to continue or not. I was really bad for a while, but lets say you do 20 jokes and 3 of them get pity laughswell, those are the 3 you keep.

Ive applied this to early morning AcroYoga sessions, latenight gymnastics training, archery lessons, etc. Make commitments in a highenergy state so that you cant back out when youre in a lowenergy state. To Go Big, Aim Small And for Tech, If You Can B.J. said it was bizarre when The Office became so successful because they werent aiming for a huge national success. They were just trying to achieve cult status with a small and loyal following. One factor that made a difference the launch of the Apple iTunes store. Their cult following was very young and techsavvy, which made them a huge hit on the iTunes store, even though they werent a huge hit on NBC at that point. The Office was one of the first shows to be an online hit, and it created one of the first viral drivers for a primetime TV show. TF Once again, see 1,000 True Fans page 292. By design, The 4Hour Workweek benefited from the launch of Twitter at the SXSW conference circa 2007, where I gave a keynote presentation. I was deliberately aiming for tech early adopters. Ive done this for each book launch since, embracing different technologies that are uncrowded but gaining influence quickly e.g., Product Hunt, BitTorrent Bundles. On Working with Steve Carell B.J. once brought a bunch of jokes to Steve Carell, who said, These just feel like jokes to me. For Steve, comedy was a byproduct of authenticity. This is the difference between a kid who knows hes cute and one who doesnt the one who knows hes cute isnt cute. The Importance of the Blue Sky Period The season writing process for The Office began with the Blue Sky Period, which was B.J.s favorite part of every year. For 2 to 4 weeks, the writers room banter was each person asking, What if . . . ? over and over again. Crazy scenarios were encouraged, not penalized. Every idea, no matter what, was valid during this period. The idea generation and filteringediting stages were entirely separate. As B.J. explained, To me, everything is idea and execution and, if you separate idea and execution, you dont put too much pressure on either of them. I consider being in a good mood the most important part of my creative process. B.J. typically spends the first few hours of his day powering up and getting in a good mood, until he gets an idea hes excited about, or until he has so much selfloathing and caffeine that he has to do something about it. See Paulo Coelho, page 511. It can take B.J. hours of walking, reading newspapers over coffee, listening to music, etc., before he hits his stride and feels he can write, his zone generally occurring between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Says B.J., I find that being in a good mood for creative work is worth the hours it takes to get in a good mood. He added, I read the book Daily Rituals, and I am demoralized by how many great people start their day very early. For lifelong night owls like me, its nice to know that when you get started each day seems to matter less than learning how to get started consistently, however your crazy ass can manage it. No Artisanal Aspirin Every day, B.J. has the same coffee a ventisize, black Pike Place coffee from Starbucks. He has found that brewing his own coffee at home is too unpredictable, and is like getting artisanal Tylenol. He wants a standard dose of caffeine. If He Taught a Comedy Writing Course P.J. ORourke, one of the big National Lampoon editors, said that if he ever taught writing or English, he would assign parodies, because you really learn something when you attempt to parody it. B.J. would therefore assign parodies of literature that students were reading and studying in other classes. This would open them up. Mischief is critical in comedy. And for Screenwriting Specifically . . . These are the screenplays B.J. would have students study Casablanca broke the form from its time period, and now it is the form. Pulp Fiction completely breaks the form chronologically. Ferris Bueller narrates the movie to the camera. The Naked Gun will do anything for a laugh. Adaptation completely comments on itself and breaks all of the rules. Learn How to Persuade and Laugh B.J. likes and recommends two podcasts related to debating, the second of which is completely farcical Intelligence Squared and The Great Debates.

I remember a breakfast with Kamal Ravikant the brother of Naval, page 546. Standing in a friends kitchen downing eggs, lox, and coffee, we spoke about our dreams, fears, obligations, and lives. Investing had become a big part of my net worth and my identity. Listing out the options I saw for my next big move, I asked him if I should raise a fund and become a fulltime venture capitalist VC, as I was already doing the work but trying to balance it with 5 to 10 other projects. He could sense my anxiety. It wasnt a dream of mine I simply felt Id be stupid not to strike while the iron was hot. He thought very carefully in silence and then said Ive been at events where people come up to you crying because theyve lost 100plus pounds on the SlowCarb Diet. You will never have that impact as a VC. If you dont invest in a company, theyll just find another VC. Youre totally replaceable. He paused again and ended with, Please dont stop writing. Ive thought about that conversation every day since. For some people, being a VC is their calling and they are the Michael Jordanlike MVPs of that world. They should cultivate that gift. But if I stop investing, no one will miss it. In 2015, that much was clear. There have never been more startup investors, andright along with themfounders basing fit on highest valuation and previously unheardof terms. There are exceptions, of course, but its crowded. If I exit through the side door, the startup party will roll on uninterrupted. Now, Im certainly not the best writer in the world. I have no delusions otherwise. People like John McPhee and Michael Lewis make me want to cry into my pillow. BUT . . . if I stop writing, perhaps Im squandering the biggest opportunity I have, created through much luck, to have a lasting impact on the greatest number of people. This feeling of urgency was multiplied 100fold in the 2 months preceding the decision, as several close friends died in accidents no one saw coming. Life is short. Put another way A long life is far from guaranteed. Nearly everyone dies before theyre ready. I was tired of being interchangeable, no matter how lucrative the game. Even if I end up wrong about the writing, Id curse myself if I didnt give it a shot. Are you squandering your unique abilities? Or the chance to find them in the first place? How Often Are You Saying Hell, Yeah!? Philosopherprogrammer Derek Sivers page 184 is one of my favorite people. His incisive thinking has always impressed me, and his hell, yeah! or no philosophy has become one of my favorite rules of thumb. From his blog Those of you who often overcommit or feel too scattered may appreciate a new philosophy Im trying If Im not saying HELL YEAH! about something, then I say no. Meaning When deciding whether to commit to something, if I feel anything less than Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!then my answer is no. When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to really throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say, HELL YEAH! Were all busy. Weve all taken on too much. Saying yes to less is the way out. To become successful, you have to say yes to a lot of experiments. To learn what youre best at, or what youre most passionate about, you have to throw a lot against the wall. Once your life shifts from pitching outbound to defending against inbound, however, you have to ruthlessly say no as your default. Instead of throwing spears, youre holding the shield. From 2007 to 2009 and again from 2012 to 2013, I said yes to way too many cool things. Would I like to go to a conference in South America? Write a timeconsuming guest article for a wellknown magazine? Invest in a startup that five of my friends were in? Sure, that sounds kinda cool, Id say, dropping it in the calendar. Later, Id pay the price of massive distraction and overwhelm. My agenda became a list of everyone elses agendas. Saying yes to too much cool will bury you alive and render you a Bplayer, even if you have Aplayer skills. To develop your edge initially, you learn to set priorities to maintain your edge, you need to defend against the priorities of others. Once you reach a decent level of professional success, lack of opportunity wont kill you. Its drowning in kinda cool commitments that will sink the ship.

How Much of Your Life Is Making Versus Managing? How Do You Feel About the Split? One of my favorite timemanagement essays is Makers Schedule, Managers Schedule by Paul Graham of Y Combinator fame. Give it a read. As investor Brad Feld and many others have observed, great creative work isnt possible if youre trying to piece together 30 minutes here and 45 minutes there. Large, uninterrupted blocks of time3 to 5 hours minimumcreate the space needed to find and connect the dots. And one block per week isnt enough. There has to be enough slack in the system for multiday, CPUintensive synthesis. For me, this means at least 3 to 4 mornings per week where I am in maker mode until at least 1 p.m. If Im reactive, maker mode is impossible. Email and texts of Were overcommitted but might be able to squeeze you in for 25K. Closing tomorrow. Interested? are creative kryptonite. I miss writing, creating, and working on bigger projects. Yes to that means no to any games of whackamole. What Blessings in Excess Have Become a Curse? Where Do You Have Too Much of a Good Thing? In excess, most things take on the characteristics of their opposite. Thus Pacifists become militants. Freedom fighters become tyrants. Blessings become curses. Help becomes hindrance. More becomes less. To explore this concept more, read up on Aristotles golden mean. In my first 1 to 2 years of angel investing, my basic criteria were simple and complement those on page 250 in RealWorld MBA Consumerfacing products or services Products I could be a dedicated power user of, products that scratched a personal itch Initial target demographic of 25 to 40yearold techsavvy males in big U.S. cities like S.F., NYC, Chicago, L.A., etc. allowed me to accelerate growthscaling with my audience Less than 10 million premoney valuation Demonstrated traction and consistent growth not doctored with paid acquisition No party roundscrowded financing rounds with no clear lead investor. Party rounds often lead to poor due diligence and few people with enough skin in the game to really care. Checking these boxes allowed me to add a lot of value quickly, even as relatively cheap labor i.e., I took a tiny stake in the company. My ability to help spread via word of mouth, and I got what I wanted great deal flow. Deals started flowing in en masse from other founders and investors. Fast forward to 2015, and great deal flow was paralyzing the rest of my life. I was drowning in inbound. Instead of making great things possible in my life, it was preventing great things from happening. Im excited to go back to basics, and this requires cauterizing blessings that have become burdens. Why Are You Investing, Anyway? For me, the goal of investing has always been simple to allocate resources e.g., money, time, energy to improve quality of life. This is a personal definition, as yours likely will be. Some words are so overused as to have become meaningless. If you find yourself using nebulous terms like success, happiness, or investing, it pays to explicitly define them or stop using them. Answering What would it look like if I had ? helps clarify things. Life favors the specific ask and punishes the vague wish. So, here investing means to allocate resources e.g., money, time, energy to improve quality of life. This applies to both the future and the present.

One could argue that I should work on my reactivity instead of avoiding stocks. Id agree on tempering reactivity, but Id disagree on fixing weaknesses as a primary investment or life strategy. All of my biggest wins have come from leveraging strengths instead of fixing weaknesses. Investing is hard enough without having to change your core behaviors. Dont push a boulder uphill just because you can. Public market sharks will eat me alive in their world, but Ill beat 99 of them in my little earlystage startup sandbox. I live in the middle of the informational switch box and know the operators. From 2007 until recently, I paradoxically found startup investing very lowstress. Ditto with some options trading. Though highrisk, I do well with binary decisions. In other words, I do a ton of homework and commit to an investment that I cannot reverse. That whats done is done aspect allows me to sleep well at night, as there is no buysell choice for the foreseeable future. Im protected from my lesser, flipflopping self. That has produced more than a few 10x to 100x ROI investments. In the last two years, however, things have changed. As fairweather investors and founders have flooded the hot tech scene, its become a deluge of noise. Where there were once a handful of micro VCs, for instance, there are now hundreds. Private equity firms and hedge funds are betting earlier and earlier. Its become a crowded playing field. Heres what that meant for me personally I received 50 to 100 pitches per week. This created an inbox problem, but it gets worse, as . . . Many of these are unsolicited cold intros, where other investors will email me and CC 2 to 4 founders with, Id love for you to meet A, B, and C without asking if they can share my email address. Those founders then loop in other people, and it cascades horribly from there. Before I know it, 20 to 50 people I dont know are emailing me questions and requests. As a result, Ive had to declare email bankruptcy twice in the last 6 months. Its totally untenable. Is there a tech bubble? That question is beyond my pay grade, and its also beside the point. Even if I were guaranteed there would be no implosion for 3 to 5 years, Id still exit now. Largely due to communication overload, Ive lost my love for the game. On top of that, the marginal minute now matters more to me than the marginal dollar a lesson learned from Naval Ravikant. But why not cut back 50, or even 90, and be more selective? Good question. Thats next . . . Are You Fooling Yourself with a Plan for Moderation? The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. Richard P. Feynman Where in your life are you good at moderation? Where are you an allornothing type? Where do you lack a shutoff switch? It pays to know thyself. The SlowCarb Diet from The 4Hour Body succeeds where other diets fail for many reasons, but the biggest is this It accepts default human behaviors versus trying to fix them. Rather than say dont cheat or you can no longer eat X, we plan weekly cheat days usually Saturdays in advance. People on diets will cheat regardless, so we mitigate the damage by regularly scheduling it and limiting it to 24 hours. Outside of cheat days, slow carbers keep domino foods out of their homes. What are domino foods? Foods that could be acceptable if humans had strict portion control, but that are disallowed because practically none of us do. Common domino foods include Chickpeas Peanut butter Salted cashews Alcohol Domino triggers arent limited to food. For some people, if they play 15 minutes of World of Warcraft, theyll play 15 hours. Its 0 or 15 hours. For me, startups are a domino food. In theory, Ill only do one deal a month or Ill only do two deals a quarter sounds great, but Ive literally NEVER seen it work for myself or any of my angel investor friends. Zero. Sure, there are ways to winnow down the pitches. Yes, you can ask any VC who introduces a deal, Is this one of the top 1 to 2 entrepreneurs you know? and reject any nos. But what if you commit to two deals a quarter and see two great ones the first week? What then? If you invest in those two, will you be able to ignore every incoming pitch for the next 10 weeks? Not likely. For me, its allornothing. I cant be half pregnant with startup investing. Whether choosing 2 or 20 startups per year, you have to filter them from the total incoming pool.

After contracting Lyme disease and operating at 10 capacity for 9 months in 2014, I made health 1. Prior to Lyme, Id worked out and eaten well, but when push came to shove, health 1 was negotiable. Now, its literally 1. What does this mean? If I sleep poorly and have an early morning meeting, Ill cancel the meeting lastminute if needed and catch up on sleep. If Ive missed a workout and have a conference call coming up in 30 minutes? Same. Latenight birthday party with a close friend? Not unless I can sleep in the next morning. In practice, strictly making health 1 has real social and business ramifications. Thats a price Ive realized I MUST be fine with paying, or I will lose weeks or months to sickness and fatigue. Making health 1 50 of the time doesnt work. Its absolutely allornothing. If its 1 50 of the time, youll compromise precisely when its most important not to. The artificial urgency common to startups makes mental and physical health a rarity. Im tired of unwarranted lastminute hurry up and sign emergencies and related fire drills. Its a culture of cortisol. Are You OverCorrelated? NOTE Two investor friends found this section slow, as theyre immersed in similar subjects. Feel free to skip if it drags on, but I think there are a few important concepts for novices in here. Correlated means that investments tend to move up or down in value at the same time. As legendary hedge fund manager Ray Dalio told Tony Robbins page 210 Its almost certain that whatever youre going to put your money in, there will come a day when you will lose 50 to 70. It pays to remember that if you lose 50, you need a subsequent 100 return to get back to where you started. That math is tough. So, how to derisk your portfolio? Many investors rebalance across asset classes to maintain certain ratios e.g., X in bonds, Y in stocks, Z in commodities, etc.. If one asset class jumps, they liquidate a part of it and buy more of lower performing classes. There are pros and cons to this, but its common practice. From 2007 to 2009, during the RealWorld MBA that taught me to angel invest page 250, less than 15 of my liquid assets were in startups. But most startups are illiquid. I commonly cant sell shares until 7 to 12 years after I invest, at least for my big winners to date. What does that mean? In 2015, startups comprised more than 80 of my assets. Yikes! Since I cant take chips off the table, the simplest first step for lowering stress was to stop investing in illiquid assets. I sold large portions of liquid stocksmostly early startup investments in China e.g., Alibabato help get me to sleep at night levels, even if they were lower than historical highs of the last 6 to 12 months. Beware of anchoring to former high prices e.g., Ill sell when it gets back to X price per share . . .. I only have 1 to 2 stock holdings remaining. Some of you might suggest hedging startup investments with short positions, and Id love to, but its not my forte, and its easy to get yourself into legal issues if done haphazardly. The best approximation to a hedge that Ive seen in the typically bullmarketdependent VC world is investing in businesses like Uber, which A have a lot of international exposure like U.S. blue chips, and B could be considered macroeconomically countercyclical. For instance, its conceivable a stock market correction or crash could simultaneously lead fewer people to buy cars andor more people to sign up as Uber drivers to supplement or replace their jobs. Ditto with Airbnb and others that have more variable than fixed costs compared to incumbents e.g., Hilton. Whats the Rush? Can You Retire and Come Back? Im in startups for the long game. In some capacity, I plan to be doing this 20 years from now. Heres the reality If youre spending your own money, or otherwise not banking on management fees, you can wait for the perfect pitches, even if it takes years. It might not be the best approach, but its more than enough. To get rich beyond your wildest dreams, it isnt remotely necessary to bet on a Facebook or Airbnb every year.

Many would argue that you need to invest in 50 to 100 startups to find that one lottery ticket. I think its possible to narrow those odds quite a bit Peter Thiel on page 232 would likely agree, and a lot of it is predicated on maintaining stringent criteria ensuring you have an informational, analytical, or behavioral advantage and TIMING. Most of my best investments were made during the Dotcom Depression of 20082009 e.g., Uber, Shopify, Twitter, etc., when only the hardcore remained standing on a battlefield littered with startup bodies. In lean times, when startups no longer grace magazine covers, founders are those who cannot help but build companies. LinkedIn in 2002 is another example. Now, of course, great companies are still built during frothy periods. The froth just makes my job and detective work 10 times harder, and the margin of safety becomes much narrower. Think of the margin of safety as wiggle room. Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors of the 20th century and a selfdescribed value investor. He aims to buy stocks at a discount below intrinsic value, so that even with a worstcase scenario, he can do well. This discount is referred to as the margin of safety, and its the bedrock principle of some of the brightest minds in the investing world e.g., Seth Klarman. It doesnt guarantee a good investment, but it allows room for error. Back to the startup world . . . I want each of my investments, if successful, to have the ability to return my entire fund, which is how much capital Ive earmarked for startups over two years, for instance. This usually means potential for a minimum 10x return. That 10x minimum is an important part of my recipe that allows margin for screwups. For the fundjustifying ROI to have a snowballs chance in hell of happening, I must A know basic algebra to ensure my investment amounts check sizes permit it, and B avoid companies that seem overpriced, where the 10x price is something the world has never seen before. If you throw lowduediligence Hail Marys everywhere and justify it with they could be the next Uber!, you will almost certainly be killed by 1,000 slowbleeding 25K paper cuts. Despite current euphoria, applying something like Pascals wager to startups is a great way to go broke. Good Startup Investors Who Suggest Being Promiscuous Are Still Methodical Its popular in startup land to talk about moonshots, the impossibly ambitious startups that will either change the world or incinerate themselves into stardust. Im a fan of funding ballsy founders which includes women, such as Tracy DiNunzio, page 313, and I want many moonshots to be funded, but heres the reality of my portfolio As Ive signed the investment docs for every big success Ive had, Ive always thought, I will never lose money on this deal. The this will be a home run or nothing deals usually end up at nothing. Im not saying such deals cant work, but I try not to specialize in them. These days, the real unicorns arent the media darlings with billiondollar valuations. Those have become terrifyingly pass. The unicorns are the highgrowth startups with a reasonable margin of safety. Fortunately, Im not in a rush, and I can wait for the tide to shift. If you simply wait for blood in the streets, for when true believers are the only ones left, you can ensure that intrinsically driven founders are at least half of your meetings.

If pain is examined and not ignored, it can show you what to excise from your life. For me, step one is always the same Write down the 20 of activities and people causing 80 or more of your negative emotions. My step two is doing a fearsetting exercise on paper page 463, in which I ask and answer, What is really the worst that could happen if I stopped doing what Im considering? And so what? How could I undo any damage? Allow me to share a realworld example a transcript of the journal page that convinced me to write this and kickstart an extended startup vacation. The questions in my mind were What is really the worst that could happen if I stopped angel investing for a minimum of 6 to 12 months? Do those worstcase scenarios really matter? How could I undo any potential damage? Could I do a 2week test? As youll notice, I made lists of the guaranteed upsides versus speculative downsides. If we define risk as I like tothe likelihood of an irreversible negative outcomewe can see how stupid and unnecessarily painful all my fretting and procrastination was. All I needed to do was put it on paper. Hit snooze 45 times, so up at 1015 instead of 833. The anxiety is mostly related to email and startups new pitches, new intros, etc. Do a 2week test where no to ALL cold intros and pitches? Why am I hesitant? For saying no to all PROS 100 guaranteed anxiety reduction Feeling of freedom Less indecision, less deliberation, far more bandwidth for CREATING, for READING, for PHYSICAL TRAINING, for EXPERIMENTS CONS i.e., why not? Might find the next Uber 10 chance Who cares? Wouldnt materialize for 79 years minimum. If Uber pops IPO, it wont matter. Not get more deals. But who cares? Dinner with 5 friends fixes it. One blog post for sourcing from readers fixes it. NONE of my best deals Shyp, Shopify, Uber, Twitter, Facebook, Alibaba, etc. came from cold intros from acquaintances. If try 2 weeks, how to ensure successful I dont even see new startup emails. No concalls. Cite concall vacation push to email or EOD endofday review with assistant. Offer additional office hours on Fridays for existing portfolio? I ultimately realized If I set up policies to avoid new startups for 2 weeks, the systems will persist. I might as well make it semipermanent and take a real startup vacation. Now its your turn What do you need a vacation from? My Challenge to You Write Down the What Ifs I am an old man and I have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened. Mark Twain He who suffers before it is necessary suffers more than is necessary. Seneca Tonight or tomorrow morning, think of a decision youve been putting off, and challenge the fuzzy what ifs holding you hostage. If not now, when? If left at the status quo, what will your life and stress look like in 6 months? In 1 year? In 3 years? Who around you will also suffer? I hope you find the strength to say no when it matters most. Im striving for the same, and only time will tell if I pull it off. So far, its turned out better than I ever could have imagined. What will I spend my time on next? More crazy experiments and creative projects, of course. Things are going to get nuts. But more importanthow could you use a new lease on life? To surf every day, like the attorney in The 4Hour Workweek who quit the rat race to build his own business paradise in Brazil? To travel with your family around the world for more than 1,000 days? To learn languages or work remotely in more than 20 countries while building a massive business? Its all possible. I know because those are all case studies from my readers. It can all be done. The options are practically limitless. So start by writing them down. Dig into your fears, and youll often find that the mental monsters are harmless scarecrows. Sometimes, it just takes a piece of paper and a few questions to create a breakthrough. What do you have to lose? Chances are, next to nothing. 3 Wise The struggle ends when the gratitude begins. Neale Donald Walsch There is no way to happinesshappiness is the way. Thich Nhat Hanh What you seek is seeking you. Rumi At the end of life, you can let a lot of the rules that govern our daily lives fly out the window.

His 2015 TED talk, What Really Matters at the End of Life, was among the top 15 most viewed TED talks of 2015. Dont believe everything that you think. This was BJs answer to what would you put on a billboard? He wasnt sure of the source but attributed it to a bumper sticker. By the end of this profile, youll see how BJ loves this type of absurdity. Stargazing as Therapy When you are struggling with just about anything, look up. Just ponder the night sky for a minute and realize that were all on the same planet at the same time. As far as we can tell, were the only planet with life like ours on it anywhere nearby. Then you start looking at the stars, and you realize that the light hitting your eye is ancient, some of the stars that youre seeing, they no longer exist by the time that the light gets to you. Just mulling the barenaked facts of the cosmos is enough to thrill me, awe me, freak me out, and kind of put all my neurotic anxieties in their proper place. A lot of peoplewhen youre standing at the edge of your horizon, at deaths door, you can be much more in tune with the cosmos. TF Ed Cooke page 517 does something surprisingly similar, and Ive started doing star therapy every night that I can. The effects are disproportionate to the effort. Delighting in Perishability The following is BJs answer to What 100 or less purchase has most positively impacted your life in recent memory? I would probably point to a beautiful pinot noir from Joseph Swan up in Sonoma County. Its like the artwork of Andy Goldsworthy, or anyone who delights in anything ephemeral. The charm in a bottle of wine, the craft, all the work that goes into it . . . actually delighting in the fact that its perishable and goes away I find really helpful. Ive gotten a lot of miles out of a beautiful bottle of wine, not just for the taste and the buzz, but the symbolism of delighting in something that goes away. Heres a Good Reason to Question Your I Cants Be patient with this and read the whole thing. Its worth it. Scuderia motorcycle dealership in San Francisco also aided BJ with his seemingly outrageous mission. TIM I hate to focus on something perhaps superficial, but you just said riding your motorcycle in passing. Now, I apologize if this sounds like a weird question, but you have three limbs that have been damaged effectively amputated. How do you ride a motorcycle? BJ You know, this was sort of a long dream that recently came true. TIM Congratulations. I mean, its fantastic. Im just so curious about the logistics. BJ Thank you. Well, its interesting you ask. The man who helped make this dream come true, Randy, ended up being my patient and our resident at Zen Hospice Project not too long after he converted my motorcycle. So theres a lot to this story, my friend. I love two wheels. I love the gyroscopic lifestyle. I love the feeling of it, and Ive always loved riding bicycles. Id always wanted to get on a motorcycle. But I kept going to shops, people would look at me, and I could never find a mechanic who was willing to take it on and try to help make it happen.

I have throttle, brake lever, and then the turn signal box all going with one hand. TIM Thats so awesome. BJ Thats it, you know. Away you go! TIM I just have to pause here for a second and just ask everyone listening What bullshit excuses do you have for not going after whatever it is that you want? Please, write in, tell us on social media why these are real excuses with bullshit afterwards. Oh my God, man, thats such a great story. The Miracle of a Snowball BJ described waking up in a burn unit after being electrocuted in college and losing three limbs A burn unit is a particular place. A gruesome place. The pain that the patients are going through is gutwrenching. Working in a burn unit is very difficult. People usually dont last in a burn unit very long as a clinician. The thing that often kills burn victims after theyve survived the initial trauma is infection, so burn units are incredibly sterile environments. Everyones gowned up, masked, and gloved. For the first several weeks, I could only have one person in my room at a time. Youre cut off from everything. Theres no day or night. There was no window in my room. Even when people are at your bedside, theres all this garb in between you and them. You have no relationship to the natural world. You can touch nothing. Youre also in a fair amount of pain, of course, which does not necessarily reward your paying attention to anything. Its not fun. So that was November. At some point in Decembermaybe it was early Januarythere were two nurses in particular I felt very close to, and it may have been one of them who brought me the snowball. One was named Joi Varcardipone. It may have been Joi. It was snowing outside and I didnt know that. She had the bright idea of smuggling in a snowball to me so I could feel snow. Man, it was just stunning. What a simple little thing, right? But she put it in my hand, and just feeling the contrast of that cold snow on my sort of crisp, burnt skinthe obnoxious, inflamed skinand watching it melt and watching the snow become water, the simple miracle of it, was just a stunner for me. It really made it so palpable that we as human beings, as long as were in this body, are feeling machines. If were cut off, if our senses are choked off, we are choked off. It was the most therapeutic moment I could imagine. I would never have guessed this. First of all, the sensation, just holding that snowball. But also the implied, inherent perspective that it helped me have. That everything changes. Snow becomes water. Its beautiful because it changes. Things are fleeting. It felt so beautiful to be part of this weird world in that moment. I felt part of the world again, rather than removed from it. It was potent. The Power of Bearing Witness and Listening I asked BJ, If you were brought in as a physician or mentor to someone who had just suffered nearly identical injuries to yours, what would your conversation look like? Or what resources, reading, or otherwise would you point them to? He replied with I think Ive gotten in trouble when Ive tried to come in with some predetermined idea of advicegiving. Oftentimes, thats not really whats needed. Its more just the camaraderie and bearing witness. So to answer your question, when I do go into folks rooms, Im there and Ill avail myself to any questions they have. But I think most of the power of the visit is just visiting, just being together and sharing this awkward body. TF Since chatting with BJ, Ive noticed how this applies in many areas. To fix someones problem, you very often just need to empathically listen to them. Even on social media or my blog, Ive realized that people knowing youre listeningvaluing them, collectivelyis more important than responding to everyone. For instance, I sometimes put a period before readers names when I reply to someone on Twitter e.g., .Widgett, thats a good question. The answer is . . ., so that everyone sees the reply. Even though I cant respond to everyone, it shows Im paying attention to blog comments and replies. Its a simple I see you. If'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

If an introverted hospice patient were to say, Give me one to three things that I can watch, do, absorb, look at, etc., without human interaction, what would your answer be? I guess Id put a picture book of Mark Rothko paintings in front of them. I would put probably any music by Beethoven into their ears. And I probably would reserve that third thing for staring into space. Favorite documentary? Grizzly Man. Any piece of art where Im not sure whether to sob or laugh hystericallyI love that feeling. Where you just go in either direction, and youre not even sure which is the correct emotion. Youre simultaneously attracted and repulsed by something. That was my experience watching that film, so I think its an amazing piece of filmmaking. Sometimes Cookies Are the Best Medicine For hospice patients at deaths door, big existential conversations arent always the needed medicine. One oddly powerful alternative is baking cookies together. Just the basic joy of smelling a cookie. It smells freaking great. And its like the snowball. Youre rewarded for being alive and in the moment. Smelling a cookie is not on behalf of some future state. Its great in the moment, by itself, on behalf of nothing. And this is another thing back to art. Art for its own sake. Art and music and dance. Part of its poignancy is its purposelessness, and just delighting in a wacky fact of perhaps a meaningless universe and how remarkable that is. One way for all of us to live until were actually dead is to prize those little moments. Advice to your 30yearold self? Let it go. I do mean to take life very seriously, but I need to take things like playfulness and purposelessness very seriously. . . . This is not meant to be light, but I think I would have somehow encouraged myself to let go a little bit more and hang in there and not pretend to know where this is all going. You dont need to know where its all going. If youre looking for a formula for greatness, the closest well ever get, I think, is this Consistency driven by a deep love of the work. Life is a continual process of arrival into who we are. Spirit animal Standard poodle Maria Popova Maria Popova TW brainpicker, Brainpickings.org has written for outlets like the Atlantic and the New York Times, but I find her most amazing project to be BrainPickings.org. Founded in 2006 as a weekly email to seven friends, Brain Pickings now gets several million readers per month. Brain Pickings is Marias onewoman labor of lovean inquiry into how to live and what it means to lead a good life. She often reads a book a day, distilling the most timeless and meaningful wisdom worth remembering and sharing. Her quality and output are staggering. Behind the Scenes Maria has a tattoo on one forearm much like Ryan Holiday, page 334 that says, What to Focus On with a bullseyelike circle below it. In the very middle of the circle is the word Happy. From Maria This is a piece by the artist Marc Johns, which I had on my wall for years. When I was going through a particularly difficult period in my life, I decided it was one of those simple, enormous truths we so easily forget, and a wonderful incantation of sorts to wake up to. To make it as inescapable as possible in beginning each day, I put it on my arm. Sometimes, the Best No Is No Reply Why put in the effort to explain why it isnt a fit, if they havent done the homework to determine if it is a fit? Maria could spend all day replying to bad pitches with polite declines. I think of her above policy often. Did the person take 10 minutes to do their homework? Are they minding the details? If not, dont encourage more incompetence by rewarding it. Those who are sloppy during the honeymoon at the beginning only get worse later.

Often I think the paradox is that accepting the requests you receive is at the expense of the quality of the very workthe reason for those requests in the first placeand thats what you always have to protect. TF This is precisely why I have stopped nearly all investing, speaking engagements, and interviews. Maria shared how famed neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks RIP used to put a piece of paper on the wall by his desk that simply said, in all caps, NO! with an exclamation point. It was to remind himself to decline invitations that took away from his writing time. What text do you refer to again and again? Right now, and this answer might be different in another 9 years, the diaries of Henry David Thoreau. Speaking of this intersection of the outer world and the inner world, nobody writes more beautifully about the immutable dialog between the two than he. There is just so muchand I mean so muchuniversal timeless truth in his private reflections, on everything from the best definition of success to the perils of sitting, which he wrote about 150 years before we started saying, Sitting is the new smoking. All those artists and writers who bemoan how hard the work is, and oh, how tedious the creative process, and oh, what a tortured genius they are. Dont buy into it. . . . As if difficulty and struggle and torture somehow confer seriousness upon your chosen work. Doing great work simply because you love it, sounds, in our culture, somehow flimsy, and thats a failing of our culture, not of the choice of work that artists make. This reminded her of a journal entry of Thoreaus from March of 1842 Thoreau writes, The really efficient laborer will be found not to crowd his day with work, but will saunter to his task surrounded by a wide halo of ease and leisure. There will be a wide margin for relaxation to his day. He is only earnest to secure the kernels of time, and does not exaggerate the value of the husk. Think of what a beautiful metaphor this is for not mistaking the huskthe outer accoutrements of productivity like busyness, or a full calendar, or a clever autorespondernot mistaking those for the kernel, the core and substance of the actual work produced. And he then says, Those who work much, do not work hard. I love that. Ours is a culture where we wear our ability to get by on very little sleep as a kind of badge of honor that symbolizes work ethic, or toughness, or some other virtuebut really, its a total profound failure of priorities and of selfrespect. To remind ourselves of this profound failure, Maria, I, and at least six other guests in this book read and recommend On the Shortness of Life by Seneca. Marias Header Image on Facebook, and a Good Rule to Live By This should be a cardinal rule of the Internet and of being human If you dont have the patience to read something, dont have the hubris to comment on it. NoteTakingDistilling the Gems Maria and I have a nearly identical notetaking process for books I highlight in the Kindle app in the iPad, and then Amazon has this function where you can, basically, see your Kindle notes and highlights on the desktop of your computer. I copy them from that page and paste them into an Evernote file to have all of my notes on a specific book in one place. I also take a screen grab of a specific iPad Kindle page with my highlighted passage, and then email that screen grab into my Evernote email because Evernote has, as you know, optical character recognition. So, when I search within it, its also going to search the text in that image. I dont have to wait until I finish the book to explore all my notes. . . . I love Evernote. Ive been using it for many years, and I could probably not get through my day without it. If Maria is reading a paper book and adding her notes in the margins what she calls marginalia, shell sometimes add BL to indicate beautiful language. I use PH, standing for phrase, to indicate the same. We both create our own indices at the beginning of books on nearblank pages, like the title page. This makes review later much faster. For instance, I might have PH 8, 12, 19, 47 to indicate the pages where Ive found great turns of phrase, and Ill add in more page numbers as they pop up.

I also take a screen grab of a specific iPad Kindle page with my highlighted passage, and then email that screen grab into my Evernote email because Evernote has, as you know, optical character recognition.

Ive been using it for many years, and I could probably not get through my day without it. If Maria is reading a paper book and adding her notes in the margins what she calls marginalia, shell sometimes add BL to indicate beautiful language. I use PH, standing for phrase, to indicate the same. We both create our own indices at the beginning of books on nearblank pages, like the title page. This makes review later much faster. For instance, I might have PH 8, 12, 19, 47 to indicate the pages where Ive found great turns of phrase, and Ill add in more page numbers as they pop up. Reading in Motion Maria does most of her longform reading at the gym on the iPad. Her first choice is an elliptical, where she does highintensity interval training HIIT. Plan B for cardio is sprints which preclude reading, which is why theyre Plan B, and Plan C is jumping rope. She travels with a weighted jump rope. When in Doubt, Scratch Your Own Itch When Kurt Vonnegut wrote Write to please just one person, what he was really saying was write for yourself. Dont try to please anyone but yourself. . . . The second you start doing it for an audience, youve lost the long game because creating something that is rewarding and sustainable over the long run requires, most of all, keeping yourself excited about it. . . . Trying to predict what an audience will be interested in and kind of pretzeling yourself to fit those expectations, you soon begin to begrudge it and become embitteredand it begins to show in the work. It always, always shows in the work when you resent it. And theres really nothing less pleasurable to read than embittered writing. TF To keep things fun for myself, I include inside jokes and Star Wars references in my books that only a few friends will get.

The Shortness of Life Seneca on Busyness and the Art of Living Wide Rather Than Living Long How to Find Your Purpose and Do What You Love 9 Learnings from 9 Years of Brain Pickings Anything about Alan Watts Alan Watts has changed my life. Ive written about him quite a bit. What is the worst advice you see or hear given in your trade or area of expertise? Follow your dreams. Its impossible to do without selfknowledge, which takes years. You discover your dream or sense of purpose in the very act of walking the path, which is guided by equal parts choice and chance. Three people or sources Maria has learned from or followed closely in the last year? Three writers and thinkers who I came to know through their exceptionally insightful and beautiful writing, and who have since become dear friends memoirist, novelist, and essayist Dani Shapiro, a kind of Virginia Woolf of our day science writer extraordinaire James Gleick cosmologist, novelist, and scienceandsociety crosspollinator Janna Levin. What is the best or most worthwhile investment youve made? A very rare edition of Maurice Sendaks illustrated Poems from William Blakes Songs of Innocence. Short and Sweet The culture of news is a culture without nuance. If you could guarantee that every public official or leader read one book, what would it be? The book would be, rather obviously, Platos The Republic.

His interview with me was the first interview he ever did, and it took the Internet by storm. Jocko spent 20 years in the U.S. Navy and commanded SEAL Team Threes Task Unit Bruiser, the most highly decorated special operations unit from the Iraq war. Upon returning to the United States, Jocko served as the officerincharge of training for all West Coast SEAL Teams, designing and implementing some of the most challenging and realistic combat training in the world. After retiring from the Navy, he cofounded Echelon Front, a leadership and management consulting company, and coauthored the 1 New York Times bestseller Extreme Ownership How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win. He now discusses war, leadership, business, and life in his toprated podcast, Jocko Podcast. He is an avid surfer, a husband, and the father of four highly motivated children.

Freeform days might seem idyllic, but they are paralyzing due to continual paradox of choice e.g., What should I do now? and decision fatigue e.g., What should I have for breakfast?. In contrast, something as simple as prescheduled workouts acts as scaffolding around which you can more effectively plan and execute your day. This gives you a greater sense of agency and feeling of freedom. Jocko adds, It also means that if you want freedom in lifebe that financial freedom, more free time, or even freedom from sickness and poor healthyou can only achieve these things through discipline. Two Is One and One Is None. This is a common expression among SEALs. Jocko explains It just means, Have a backup. If you have two of something, you will break or lose one and end up with one remaining if you have one, you will break or lose it and be screwed. One of my favorite Franz Kafka quotes is related Better to have, and not need, than to need, and not have. Where can you eliminate single points of failure in your life or business? Jocko adds, And dont just have backup gearhave a backup plan to handle likely contingencies. Exposing Yourself to Darkness to See the Light I think that in order to truly experience the light and the bright, you have to see the darkness. I think if you shield yourself from the darkness, youll not appreciateand fully understandthe beauty of life. On July 4, 2016, I texted Jocko to thank him for his service. We exchanged hellos, and I asked him how he and his family were doing. He responded All good here. With the exception of the book Im reading about the My Lai massacre. What a nightmare. Thankful for what we have. . . . All of the interviewees in this book have methods for achievement. Most whove been successful for decades also have methods to cultivate gratitude. Remembering his friends who made the ultimate sacrifice in war, Jocko is truly grateful for every sunrise, every smile, every laugh, every breath. He also deliberately and regularly exposes himself to the stories of those who have been subjected to horror, misfortune, and darkness. If youre open to reading a dark book to help put things in perspective, If This Is a Man and The Truce often combined into one volume by Primo Levi are two of my favorites. They were recommended to me by the illusionist David Blaine, who has Levis concentration camp number tattooed on his arm. When I asked him, What did you learn from the book? he answered Everything. If You Want to Be Tougher, Be Tougher If you want to be tougher mentally, it is simple Be tougher. Dont meditate on it. These words of Jockos helped one listenera drug addictget sober after many failed attempts. The simple logic struck a chord Being tougher was, more than anything, a decision to be tougher. Its possible to immediately be tougher, starting with your next decision. Have trouble saying no to dessert? Be tougher. Make that your starting decision. Feeling winded? Take the stairs anyway. Ditto. It doesnt matter how small or big you start. If you want to be tougher, be tougher. Take Extreme Ownership of Your World While Jocko was a SEAL Task Unit commander, the SEAL Commodore, who led all SEALs on the west coast, would hold meetings with all the Task Unit commanders to assess the needs and problems of the troops, then marshal resources to help them The SEAL Commodore would go around the room, because he wants to get direct feedback from the frontline leaders. These guys are my peers. Hed ask one of the leaders, What do you need? and the leader would say, Well, the boots that we have are okay in the hot weather, but were getting ready to be in a cooler environment. We need new boots, and we need them this week before our next training block. The Commodore would reply, Okay, got it. Then hed ask the next person, whod say, When were out at the desert training facility and theres no Internet, our guys are disconnected. We really need to get WiFi out there. Okay, got it. The next guy would say, We need more helicopter training support, because we dont feel like were working around helicopters enough. We really need that. The Commodore would agree to take care of that as well. Eventually, hed get to me. The Commodore would say Jocko, what do you need? and I would say, Were good, sir. The implication is obvious If I have problems, Im going to handle them. Im going to take care of them, and Im not going to complain. I took extreme ownership of my world. The way that worked was twofold. When I did need something, it was something significant, it was something real. And when I told the Commodore, Hey, boss, we need this right here, I would get it almost instantaneously because he knew that I really, truly needed it.

For me, when I wake up in the morningand I dont know whyIm thinking about the enemy and what theyre doing. I know Im not on active duty anymore, but its still in my head that theres a guy in a cave somewhere, hes rocking back and forth, and hes got a machine gun in one hand and a grenade in the other. Hes waiting for me, and were going to meet. When I wake up in the morning, Im thinking to myself What can I do to be ready for that moment, which is coming? That propels me out of bed. TF This story has compelled so many listeners to start waking early that there is a 0445club hashtag on Twitter, featuring pictures of wristwatches. Its still going strong more than a year after the podcast. Pomegranate White Tea and Beyond Jocko drinks no coffee and nexttono caffeine. His one indulgence is occasional pomegranate white tea . . . which I believe hits your soul pretty well. But . . . During my first deployment to Iraq, we did longer patrols in the vehicles, and I would havein a series of pouches hanging in front of my seata flashbang grenade and then another flashbang grenade, and then a frag grenade, which is the grenade that kills people, and then another frag grenade. And then, the next three pouches were Red Bull, Red Bull, Red Bull. TIM But youre an intense guy, which is meant as a compliment. What are you like on three Red Bulls? JOCKO More Jocko. TF Jocko doesnt want to need caffeine. On a similar note, another SEAL friend who regularly eats only one meal per day sent me the following I think its hilarious when some special operations guys get grumpy if they dont have protein powder every 2 hours. I have a huge advantage if I can turn anything into fuel, including garbage, or go without food. What Makes a Good Commander? The immediate answer that comes to mind is humility. Because youve got to be humble, and youve got to be coachable. . . . Later, when I was running training, we would fire a couple leaders from every SEAL Team because they couldnt lead. And 99.9 of the time, it wasnt a question of their ability to shoot a weapon, it wasnt because they werent in good physical shape, it wasnt because they were unsafe. It was almost always a question of their ability to listen, open their mind, and see that, maybe, theres a better way to do things. That is from a lack of humility. . . . We put these guys through very realistic and challenging training, to say the least. If there are any guys who went through training when I was running it, right now theyre chuckling because it was very realistic. In fact, it was borderline psychotic. We put so much pressure on these guys and overwhelmed them. A good leader would come back and say something like one of the following, I lost it, I didnt control it. I didnt do a good job. I didnt see what was happening. I got too absorbed in this little tiny tactical situation that was right in front of me. Either theyd make those criticisms about themselves, or theyd ask, What did I do wrong? And when you told them, theyd nod their head, pull out their notebook, and take notes. That right there, thats a guy whos going to make it, whos going to get it right. The arrogant guys, who lacked humility, they couldnt take criticism from othersand couldnt even do an honest selfassessment because they thought they already knew everything. Stay humble or get humbled. On the Importance of Detachment I was probably 20 or 21 years old. I was in my first SEAL platoon. Were on an oil rig in California doing training. Wed come up on this level of this oil rig, and weve never been on an oil rig before. Theres gear and boxes and stuff everywhere on these levels, and you can see through the floors because they are steel gratingnot solid material. Its a complex environment. So, we come up, and we all get on this platform and, because of the complexity, everybody freezes. Im kind of waiting.'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

I didnt see what was happening. I got too absorbed in this little tiny tactical situation that was right in front of me. Either theyd make those criticisms about themselves, or theyd ask, What did I do wrong? And when you told them, theyd nod their head, pull out their notebook, and take notes. That right there, thats a guy whos going to make it, whos going to get it right. The arrogant guys, who lacked humility, they couldnt take criticism from othersand couldnt even do an honest selfassessment because they thought they already knew everything. Stay humble or get humbled. On the Importance of Detachment I was probably 20 or 21 years old. I was in my first SEAL platoon. Were on an oil rig in California doing training. Wed come up on this level of this oil rig, and weve never been on an oil rig before. Theres gear and boxes and stuff everywhere on these levels, and you can see through the floors because they are steel gratingnot solid material. Its a complex environment. So, we come up, and we all get on this platform and, because of the complexity, everybody freezes. Im kind of waiting. Im a new guy, so I dont really feel like I should be doing anything. But then I said to myself, Somebodys got to do something, so I just did whats called high port with my gun I pointed my gun up toward the air to indicate Im not a shooter right now. I took one step back off the line, looked around, and I saw what the picture was. Then I said, Hold left, move right. Everybody heard it, and they did it. And I said to myself, Hmmm . . . thats what you need to do step back and observe. I realized that detaching yourself from the situation, so you can see whats happening, is absolutely critical. Now, when I talk to executives or midlevel managers, I explain to them that Im doing that all the time. It sounds horrible, but its almost like, sometimes, Im not a participant in my own life. Im an observer of that guy whos doing it. So, if Im having a conversation with you and were trying to discuss a point, Im watching and saying to myself, Wait, am I being too emotional right now? Wait a second, look at him. What is his reaction? Because Im not reading you correctly if Im seeing you through my own emotion or ego. I cant really see what youre thinking if Im emotional. But if I step out of that, now I can see the real you and assess if you are getting angry, or if your ego is getting hurt, or if youre about to cave because youre just fed up with me. Whereas, if Im raging in my own head, I might miss all of that. So being able to detach as a leader is critical. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? The first people who come to mind are the real heroes of Task Unit Bruiser Marc Lee, first SEAL killed in Iraq. Mike Monsoor, second SEAL killed in Iraq, posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor after he jumped on a grenade to save three of our other teammates. And finally, Ryan Job, one of my guys who was gravely wounded in Iraq, blinded in both eyes, but who made it back to America, was medically retired from the Navy, but who died from complications after the 22nd surgery to repair his wounds. Those guys, those men, those heroes, they lived, and fought, and died like warriors. Mostgifted or recommended books? I think theres only one book that Ive ever given and Ive only given it to a couple people. Thats a book called About Face, by Colonel David H. Hackworth. The other book that Ive read multiple times is Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy. Favorite documentaries? Restrepo, which Im sure youve seen. TF This was coproduced and cofilmed by Sebastian Junger, the next profile. There is also an hourlong program called A Chance in Hell The Battle for Ramadi. Quick Takes You walk into a bar. What do you order from the bartender? Water. What does your diet generally look like? It generally looks like steak. What kind of music does Jocko listen to? Two samples For workoutsBlack Flag, My War, side B In generalWhite Buffalo Behind the Scenes Peter Attia page 59 introduced me to Jocko. I once witnessed Peter interview Jocko on stage. Peter said to the crowd, Jocko can do 70 strict pullups . . . and Jocko quickly interjected with, No, I cant do 70 pullups. I can do 67. Jocko is a big fan of the Hardcore History podcast, hosted by Dan Carlin page 285, as am I.

As an awardwinning journalist, he has received both a National Magazine Award and a Peabody Award. Junger is also a documentary filmmaker whose debut film, Restrepo, codirected with Tim Hetherington, was nominated for an Academy Award and won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance. Restrepo, which chronicles the deployment of a platoon of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistans Korengal Valley, is widely considered to have broken new ground in war reporting. Junger has since produced and directed three additional documentaries about war and its aftermath. How do you become a man in a world that doesnt require courage? Elaboration In terms of our communities and our society at home, we thankfully no longer have to organize young men and prepare them for group violence so that we can survive. Thats been the human norm for 2 million years, either from predators or from other humans. . . . If you dont give young men a good and useful group to belong to, they will create a bad group to belong to. But one way or another, theyre going to create a group, and theyre going to find something, an adversary, where they can demonstrate their prowess and their unity. The Calming Effect of Acting Instead of Waiting The special forces guys were the opposite of those in the nonelite divisions. As soon as they heard they were about to experience an overwhelming attack, their cortisol levels dropped. They got super calm. The reason their cortisol levels dropped was because it was stressful for them to wait for the unknown, but as soon as they knew they were going to be attacked, they had a plan of action. They started filling sandbags. They started cleaning their rifles. They started stockpiling their ammo, getting the plasma bags ready, whatever they do before an attack. All of that busyness gave them a sense of mastery and control that actually made them feel less anxious than just waiting around on an average day in a dangerous place. The Upside of Disaster Whats very fortunate, beautiful, wonderful, and also, in a weird way, tragic about modern society, is that crisis has been removed. When you reintroduce a crisis like in the Blitz in London or an earthquake that I wrote about in Avezzano, Italy, early in the 20th century, things change. In Avezzano, something like 95 of the population was killed. Im going from memory, but unbelievable casualty, just like a nuclear strike. . . . People had to rely on each other, so everyoneupperclass people, lowerclass people, peasants, and nobilitysort of crouched around the same campfires. One of the survivors said, The earthquake gave us what the law promises but does not, in fact, deliver, which is the equality of all men. That feeling of us, it buffers many people from their psychological demons. Sebastian discussing why unifying disasters and crisis, like 911 or the World War II Blitz bombings on London, often results in dramatic decreases in suicide, violent crime, mental illness symptoms, etc. The Point of Journalism Is the Truth The point of journalism is the truth. The point of journalism is not to improve society. There are things, there are facts, there are truths that actually feel regressive, but it doesnt matter, because the point of journalism isnt to make everything better. Its to give people accurate information about how things are. On Most Writers Block in NonFiction Its not that Im blocked. Its that I dont have enough research to write with power and knowledge about that topic. It always means, not that I cant find the right words, but rather that I dont have the ammunition. . . . I dont have the goods. I have not gone into the world and brought back the goods that Im writing about, and you never want to solve a research problem with language. You never want to . . . thread the needle and get through a thin patch in your research just because youre such a prose artist. Dont Use Verbal Crutches God, I really dislike laziness. . . .

I would say to myself, The public is not a threat. When you realize that we all need each other, and that we can all learn from each other, your stage fright goes away. What would your 70yearold self advise your current self? The world is this continually unfolding set of possibilities and opportunities, and the tricky thing about life is, on the one hand having the courage to enter into things that are unfamiliar, but also having the wisdom to stop exploring when youve found something worth sticking around for. That is true of a place, of a person, of a vocation. Balancing those two thingsthe courage of exploring and the commitment to stayingand getting the ratio right is very hard. I think my 70yearold self would say Be careful that you dont err on one side or the other, because you have an illconceived idea of who you are. What Would You Die For? At the end of our 2plushour conversation, I asked Sebastian if he had any parting thoughts. Who would you die for? What ideas would you die for? The answer to those questions, for most of human history, would have come very readily to any persons mouth. Any Comanche would tell you instantly who they would die for and what they would die for. In modern society, it gets more and more complicated, and when you lose the ready answer to those ancient human questions, you lose a part of yourself. You lose a part of your identity. I would ask people, Who would you die for? What would you die for? And what do you owe your community? In our case, our community is our country. What do you owe your country, other than your taxes? Is there anything else you owe all of us? Theres no right answer or wrong answer, but its something that I think everyone should ask themselves. Mostgifted or recommended book?

He has clocked 412 for the mile, 904 for 2 miles, 2405 for 5 miles, and 221 for a marathon. After our interview in my home, I had tea, and Sebastian took a few minutes to fire off emails from his laptop. I noticed him typing with one hand and asked him if hed injured himself. He laughed sheepishly and explained there was no injury. As it turns out, Sebastian never learned to touch type. He has written all of his books and articles by hunting and pecking with one hand.

Preface Being wise includes knowing how to defend yourself or disappear when needed. Step one is becoming aware of the threats. Google Can Determine Who Lives or Dies The fact of the matter is, back in 2008 in Mumbai, terrorists were using search engines like Google to determine who shall live and who shall die. . . . When youre sharing on Facebook, its not just the media and marketing companies that you need to be concerned about. How Business Travelers Often Get Kidnapped Organized crime outfits are good at bribing airline employees for flight manifests lists of passengers. They then Google each name, create a list of apparent highvalue targets, and arrive early to look for the right names on limo driver signs. They pay or threaten the actual limo drivers, who leave and are replaced The executive flying in from New York, San Francisco, or London would then get off the plane, see the piece of cardboard with their name on it, walk up to the person who was dressed like a limousine driver, get into a car, and get kidnapped as a result. There are actually a few people who were killed. TF This is why I use Uber or pseudonyms for any car service pickups around the world. By using a madeup name for your car reservation, if you see a placard with your real name on it, you know its a setup. If you become successfulor simply appear successful on the Internetand travel a lot overseas, this is not paranoia. Personalized Bioweapons Marc and I discussed how criminals or intelligent lunatics could use your genetic information, if its made public or hacked Ill give you a perfect example. Theres a medicine called Warfarin, which is a blood thinner. Theres a certain small percentage of people that have a genetic marker that makes them allergic to that, and its deadly if taken. So that would be a perfect example. Its a common pharmaceutical that exists today, and you cant know whether or not someone is allergic to Warfarin by looking at somebody. But if you have their genetic data, now you have that additional piece of information. You know about it, and it could be fatal. TF I spoke about personalized bioweapons nearly 10 years ago with a qualified former NASA scientist. These are real. To stretch your brain on this subject, read a great article of Marcs in the Atlantic titled Hacking the Presidents DNA. If youre a potential highprofile target, you need to think defensively. CRISPR and related technologies could potentially make the near future a boom era for biological weapons. Keep your genetic data very close to your chest. Even if you use pseudonyms, Ive seen companies that can produce facial features from DNA info. Its going to be practically impossible to anonymize. Do you have any quotes that you live your life by or think of often? Among others The future is already hereits just unevenly distributed.William Gibson If we continue to develop our technology without wisdom or prudence, our servant may prove to be our executioner.Omar N. Bradley What is the worst advice you see or hear given in your trade or area of expertise? If you have nothing to hide, then you dont have to worry about privacy, and that we must sacrifice our privacy in order to have security. Three people or sources youve learned fromor followed closelyin the last year? David Brooks, The Moral Bucket List. Nir Eyal, Hooked. Anything by Kevin Kelly, most recently The Inevitable. Spirit animal Honey badger Samy Kamkar Samy Kamkar TW samykamkar, samy.pl is one of the most innovative computer hackers in the United States. He is best known for creating the fastestspreading virus of all time, a MySpace worm named Samy, for which he was raided by the United States Secret Service. More recently, he created SkyJack, a custom drone that hacks into any nearby drones, allowing any operator to control a swarm of devices. He also discovered illicit mobile phone tracking by Apple iPhone, Google Android, and Microsoft Windows Phone mobile devices. His findings led to a series of classaction lawsuits against these companies and a privacy hearing on Capitol Hill. Why is Samy in Wise? Once again, because feeling safe and enjoying your resources isnt solely about offense. Its important to have basic defenses in place. Life is a fullcontact sport, and the black swans will come visiting sooner or later. Back Story Samy wasperhaps surprisinglyone of my ObiWans for the Dating Game episode of The Tim Ferriss Experiment TV show. In 15 to 20 minutes, he demonstrated how he optimized and automated nearly all of his online dating in L.A. and other cities. Based on all of his data crunching, he told me shirtless pics and animals were like crack. I didnt believe him, so we tested roughly a dozen of my preexisting profile pics alongside a new, shirtless pic of me with a kitten held over my shoulder. It was an embarrassing, ludicrous pic. Even Neil Strauss page 347 didnt want it to win. Alas, it did. Music for the Zone To get in the zone, Samy likes to code to AudioMolly.com, The Glitch Mob, and Infected Mushroom. Based on his recommendation, I found some of my current favoritesPegboard Nerds Blackout and David Starfire Karunaon AudioMolly. What advice would you give to your 20yearold self? Stop committing felonies. Tools of a Hacker Ive often asked Samy, How can I protect myself against people like you? The tools below address more than 90 of the most common security threats. I currently use about half of them. This chapter can be dense, so feel free to skim and return to it as a reference, if needed.

If you do nothing else, heres a 60second precaution Put tape or a cover over your laptop camera and perhaps your phone when youre not using it. Samy explained to me how simple it is to hijack cameras. Its terrifying. This could be used to surveil your house and determine when youre not home. It could also be used to catch you playing patty cake with Captain Winky. Covering it is 60 seconds well spent. Enter Samy How to protect your data on your computer and mobile devices, in case your systems are ever stolen or in case youre traveling abroad or across borders Use BitLocker on Windows or FileVault on OS X. Your data will be encrypted when the machine is off or suspended. Encrypt your hard drive using full disk encryption in order to keep your confidential data protected in case your machine is ever lost or stolen, preventing others from extracting data from your device without the password. Youll Never Take Me Alive! is a free tool for Windows and OS X machines so that if the machine is ever disconnected from AC power or wired Ethernet while the screen is locked TF e.g., someone grabs your laptop out of a coffee shop and sprints off, the system will go into hibernate, preventing a laptop thief from accessing your encrypted data. This requires you to be using FileVault or BitLocker disk encryption. Use a PIN on your iOS or Android device to encrypt the data locally on the device. While a PIN may seem insecure, your data is typically well protected due to the mechanisms in place to prevent brute forcing of PIN codes onto your device, and the relatively secure though not perfect hardware implementations of security within iOS and Android. TF If on iPhone, Id also recommend increasing your PIN from 4 to 8 characters. If someone is trying to bruteforce crack your password, this takes the time required from roughly 4 to 5 days to 100 days iPhone Settings Touch ID Passcode Change Passcode Dont ever use the same password twice! Differentiate your passwords enough that someone cant guess a password for one site by knowing the password of another. I try to use long but simple passwords that are easy to remember like lyrics from a song relevant to the site. A long password, even if mostly English words, is typically stronger than a short password with random characters. For casual, nontechnical people, I would suggest using a program like 1Password or LastPass or KeePass, if you want opensource to remember all of these. Personally, I use VeraCrypt below, but its more involved. The difference between this and a tool like 1Password is that 1Password is built into the browser and if a vulnerability is found, the software itself has access to my passwords the next time I use it. Its unlikely to happen, but there is a small risk. Consider using the free, crossplatform tool VeraCrypt. If you feel you might ever be compelled to reveal a password for your computer such as at a border crossing or by rubber hose cryptanalysis being beaten by a rubber hose until you squeal, you can use hidden volumes to hide data with two passwords, providing you plausible deniability. Such hidden volumes are encrypted disks or directories that have one password that decrypts to show various files that you placed and are comfortable with revealing, while a secondary password can decrypt the same folder containing the actual, confidential data youre protecting, with no way to prove whether theres a single password or two passwords for the volume. I personally dont use a second password for any of my encrypted drives. . . . or do I? Detecting Malware or Software Behaving Badly on Your Computer A great amount of software will make outbound connections to the Internet, typically for legitimate purposes, though not necessarily. If you wish to prevent or at least learn when an application is doing this, you can use NetLimiter on Windows or Little Snitch on OS X to detect and decide to allow or block when a specific application is connecting out, and learn where its connecting to. You can use Wireshark for further analysis, mentioned below. You can use BlockBlock on OS X, which notifies you if a program is trying to install itself to run upon startup, even when its hiding itself in a nook or cranny of your system, and you have the clear option to block it if you wish. Some viruses or malware or simply annoying software will try to do this and you can decide if it should run at startup or not. Dont plug in any USB device that you dont trust! There are even ecigarettes that charge over USB that carry malware. If you wish to charge something, its safer to use a USB chargeradapter for a wall outlet rather than your computer.

Anonymizing Yourself on the Internet Tor is a free, crossplatform software that allows you to browse the Internet anonymously and helps you defend against network surveillance. It will help change your IP address each time you use it as well as encrypt your network communication, however the last hop in the chain of Tor will always be able to see your unencrypted traffic, though it will not be able to detect your IP address. I would trust Tor over any VPN service as no Tor node knows both your IP and what youre accessing, unlike a VPN, which could be compelled to share that data. When you take a picture with your smartphone, its typically recording your GPS coordinates and other data about the picture, such as device used, into the image. This is called EXIF data and is metadata thats hidden in the image, and anyone can recover it if you send the image directly to them. You can disable storing location in phones on various platforms See Settings, Systems Preferences, etc. For instance, on iPhone 6 Settings Privacy Location Services or use free software after the fact to do this. Search for EXIF removal tool and find a tool for your operating system or mobile platform to do this when you wish to hide your location from images. If you want to be particularly crafty, you can use a free app called LinkLiar on OS X to spoof or randomize your MAC address. A MAC address is a fixed, unique hardware identifier of the network device within your computer and never changes otherwise. Ive also discovered that some large companies track MAC addresses to know the last place youve been, so it doesnt hurt to adjust it every once in a while. Accessing Interesting Data and Controlling the Websites You Visit If a website is delivering images, video, or audio to your computer, that means in most cases you can download it directly, even if the site attempts to stop you. In Chrome similar tools exist in Firefox and Safari, you can go to View Developer Developer Tools, click on the Network tab, refresh the page, and see all content going across. You can then rightclick any file, such as an image that the site wouldnt otherwise let you download, and click Copy Link Address to get the direct URL. The Elements tab is also particularly useful. TF You can also use this to easily copy and paste good quotes that some sites like to prevent you from copy and pasting. Using the same Developer Tools, if a site is ever trying to force you to sign up, fill out a form you dont want to fill out, or otherwise cover the page with obtrusive windows or darkening the page, you can use the Elements tab in the Developer Tools mentioned above, rightclick on any element in the tab, and click Remove. Dont worry, if you remove the wrong thing, you can simply refresh the page and try again! You are only affecting the page on your own computer, but this can be a useful tool to adjust a page to your liking. Google Reverse Image Search is a surprisingly useful tool if youre ever trying to perform reconnaissance, or just learn where an image came from or where else it might be used on the Internet. Simply browse to Google Images and drag and drop the image onto the page. Tools that Hackers Use Though Im not a lawyer, using these tools on a network and devices you have reign over, such as your home LAN, will likely not carry any consequence. The only way to understand the security and insecurity of your own network is to test the same tools attackers would use. I highly suggest those interested in learning use theseboth the good guys and the bad guys are using these same exact tools! To learn about some of the starting tools a hacker, attacker, or someone just curious about security would use, Id suggest looking at beginning tools such as Wireshark, Charles web debugging proxy, NightHawk ARPND spoofing and password sniffing, arpy ARP spoofing, dsniff password sniffing, and Kali Linux penetration testing and looking up tutorials on network intrusion, sniffing, and maninthemiddling. Within a few minutes and with a tool like Wireshark, you can start seeing all the traffic going in and out of your computer, while tools like Nighthawk and arpy in conjunction with Wireshark can help you inspect and intercept all traffic on a network! To further dive into security, Id suggest learning to program. Its easier than you think!

Within a few minutes and with a tool like Wireshark, you can start seeing all the traffic going in and out of your computer, while tools like Nighthawk and arpy in conjunction with Wireshark can help you inspect and intercept all traffic on a network!

Spirit animal Chris Fussell Middleearth elf General Stanley McChrystal Chris Fussell Stanley McChrystal TW StanMcChrystal, mcchrystalgroup.com retired from the U.S. Army as a fourstar general after more than 34 years of service. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates described McChrystal as perhaps the finest warrior and leader of men in combat I ever met. From 2003 to 2008, McChrystal served as commander of Joint Special Operations Command JSOC, where he was credited with the death of Abu Musab alZarqawi, leader of AlQaeda in Iraq. His last assignment was as the commander of all American and Coalition forces in Afghanistan. He is a senior fellow at Yale Universitys Jackson Institute for Global Affairs and the cofounder of McChrystal Group, a leadership consulting firm. Chris Fussell TW FussellChris is a former U.S. Navy SEAL officer, former aidedecamp righthand man for General McChrystal, and a current senior executive at McChrystal Group. The Purpose of Life Is a Life of Purpose. This is Stans answer to If you could put a billboard anywhere and write anything on it, what would it say? It is a quote from Robert Byrne. One Primary Meal Per Day Stan rewards himself with a large dinner at night and doesnt do well with smaller meals throughout the day. On Creating a Red Team STAN The concept of red team is designed to test a plan. What happens is, as you develop a planyouve got a problem and you develop a way to solve that problemyou fall in love with it. You start to dismiss the shortcomings of it, simply because, I think, thats the way the mind works. . . . Sometimes youre actually skipping over real challenges to it, or vulnerabilities in it, because you just want it to work. As we describe it, sometimes a plan can end up being a string of miracles, and thats not a real solid plan. So red teaming is You take people who arent wedded to the plan and ask them, How would you disrupt this plan or how would you defeat this plan? If you have a very thoughtful red team, youll produce stunning results. Everyone Says Youre Great, but . . . TIM Ive heard stories of how you vet people for the McChrystal Group. And Ive heard that you sometimes throw a statement out that people need to finish. Specifically, lets say you were interviewing Chris, youd say, Everyone says Chris is great, but . . . and then youd sit there in silence. Do you do that? STAN I do do that. . . . It puts a person in the position of having to try to articulate what they think the perception of them by others is. Because there is a perception, and often in the vetting process, well figure that out because well get inputs from other people. But if you asked somebody and you said, Everybody loves you but they dont love this about you, or theyd hire you but . . . it accomplishes a couple of things. One, it forces them to come to grips with What is it people dont love about me? And the second is, theyve got to say it to you. It could be very common knowledge, but if they dont have the courage to face up to it and tell somebody whos thinking about hiring them, thats a window into personality, I think. TIM What are the answers that are a red flag to you, and what are the answers that are not a red flag? Or Chris, if you want to tackle . . . CHRIS I always like to flip the usual interview approach on its head and say something like, Were a small community. You and I havent worked together, but I know a lot of your peers, and after this, were going to follow up with people who like you and who dont like you. No ones perfect, and I have my naysayers just like you do. What will the people who dont hold you in highest regard say about you? To me, the most important thing was that they have an answer. A It shows the courage to be able to address it, and B it shows selfawareness that I might be top peerrated and have this great career, but theres somebody out there, and heres what theyd probably say. . . . Theyd say I was selfserving at one time, or I appear too good on paper, or Im lazy on these types of physical training, or whatever the case may be. Show me that, if you identify it, youre working on it. I dont care what you think about it. I just want to know that youre aware of how other people view you. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? CHRIS Ill answer it this way, and'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? CHRIS Ill answer it this way, and I dont know if this gets to the exact point. I had a great mentor early on in my career give me advice that Ive heeded until now, which is that you should have a running list of three people that youre always watching someone senior to you that you want to emulate, a peer who you think is better at the job than you are and who you respect, and someone subordinate whos doing the job you didone, two, or three years agobetter than you did it. If you just have those three individuals that youre constantly measuring yourself off of, and youre constantly learning from them, youre going to be exponentially better than you are. Stans Workout Routine Stan starts his workout at home, if hes at home Set of pushups to max reps 100 situps, 3minute plank, 2 to 3 minutes of yoga Set of pushups to max reps 50 to 100 crunchlike crossover legs up, 2.5minute plank, 2 to 3 minutes of yoga Set of pushups to max reps 50 to 100 crossover situps the first two variations combined, 2minute plank, 2 to 3 minutes of yoga Set of pushups to max reps 60 flutter kicks, followed by static hold 1.5minute plank set of crunches 1minute plank 2 to 3 minutes of yoga STAN Then Ill leave my house and go to the gym, because my gym opens at 530. Its three blocks from my house. TIM I assume we mean a.m. STAN Yeah. If I get up at 4, I can do all that from 430 to about 520, then at 525, go down to my gym. When I get to the gym, I do four sets of pullups, alternated with inclined bench press and standing curls. Onelegged balance exercises are the rest break between them. Then Ill do a few other things, and I can do all that in 30, 35 minutes. So by 615 or 620, I can be done at the gym, head back home, get cleaned up, and then start work. Why Exercise Is Important to Stan Aside from the selfimage and performance aspects It also puts discipline in the day. I find that if the day is terrible, but I worked out, at the end of the day Ill go, Well, I had a good workout, almost no matter what happens. When the Rolling Stone article came out, it came out at about 130 in the morning. I found out about it, I made a couple of calls, I knew we had a big problem, and I put my clothes on and ran for an hour. Clear my head, stretch myself. It didnt make it go away, but that is something that I do in those situations. Three Practices for Mental Toughness The following was in response to What are three tests or practices from the military that civilians could use to help develop mental toughness? STAN The first is to push yourself harder than you believe youre capable of. Youll find new depth inside yourself. The second is to put yourself in groups who share difficulties, discomfort. We used to call it shared privation. Youll find that when you have been through that kind of difficult environment, that you feel more strongly about that which youre committed to. And finally, create some fear and make individuals overcome it. TF I think these three elements largely explain the exploding popularity of obstacle course racing like Spartan Race see Joe De Sena, page 38 and Worlds Toughest Mudder see Amelia Boone, page 2. Advice to Your 30YearOld Self? STAN I think up through probably 35, I was very much a control freak, because the size of the organizations I commanded, and I was part of, were small enough where I could micromanage them. I had a fairly forceful personality, and if you worked hard and studied hard, you could just about move all the chess pieces, no problem. Around age 35 to 40, as you get up to battalion level, which is about 600 people, suddenly, youre going to have to lead it a different way, and what youre really going to have to do is develop people. The advice Id give to anyone young is its really about developing people who are going to do the work. Unless you are going to go do the task yourself, then the development time you spend on the people who are going to do that task, whether they are going to lead people doing it or whether they are actually going to do it, every minute you spend on that is leveraged, is exponential return.

For Those of Us Who Say We Dont Have Time to Read . . . Stan consumes most of his books as audiobooks, a habit acquired overseas, as print books are cumbersome to lug around on deployment. He probably now reads via audio 70 of the time. STAN I learned to run with audiobooks. My mind will stay collected on it when I lift weights. . . . I also have a little set of speakers in my bathroom. So I go in in the morning, and Im listening to one book there. I turn it on and Ill listen while I brush my teeth, while I shave, while I put my PT clothes on, because my wifes out in the bedroom. . . . Ive found that I go through books very, very quickly, because if youre working out an hour and a half a day, you actually go through books much faster than you would if you just had reading time. . . . I tend to like sweeping history stories of an era thats 20, 30, 40 years, or big projects like the building of the Panama Canal, the building of the Boulder Dam now known as the Hoover Dam, because theyve got a beginning, middle, and end, and challenges. I will also do binge reading. I did seven or eight books on George Washington and other founding fathers, and because theyre all mutually overlapping, suddenly you know more about the era, and the new one is more interesting because its filling in holes. So Ill binge on one subject for a while, and then on another subject. Books to read for insight into the realities of combat? CHRIS Well, a classic in the special operations community is Gates of Fire, by Steven Pressfield. Really highly read. . . . Stans mostgifted book I have probably given the most copies of a book written in 1968 by Anton Myrer, called Once an Eagle. Its a story of two characters, who both entered the military during the first World War, and it follows them up through the second World War into the postwar years. Stans favorite film The Battle of Algiers. It takes about 15 minutes to pull you in, but be patient and stick with it. I put off watching this for months, and I wish Id watched it immediately after Stan recommended it. This documentarystyle film, shot in Algiers, recreates the increasingly violent events of 1957, as occupied Algeria fought for independence from France. It humanizes both sides and is extremely relevant to current events. On top of that, it explores the good and the bad of broader human nature. You can tell the true character of a man by how his dog and his kids react to him. If you dont believe in God, you should believe in the technology thats going to make us immortal.

In San Francisco, I roped him into a number of firsts, including AcroYoga page 52 and getting whipped with branches at Russian baths. He is an investor in DietBet.com, which Ive used with tens of thousands of fans without realizing he was involved. It forces you to put money on the line as an incentive to lose weight, and it works. Those who reach certain milestones win and receive a portion of the total pot. Players have lost more than 5 million pounds and DietBet has paid out more than 21 million. The secrets to life are hidden behind the word clich. Shay recalled being on a specific bike ride during his rapid weightloss period I remember exactly where I was. I thought to myself, The secrets to life are hidden behind the word clich. So any time you hear something that you think is a clich, my tip to you is to perk your ears up and listen more carefully. He had heard certain phrases like Eat more vegetables a million times, but ignored them for years, as it all seemed too simplistic. Ultimately, it was the simple that worked. He didnt need sophisticated answers. They were right in front of him the whole time. What advice are you ignoring because you think its trite or clichd? Can you mine it for any testable action?

Learning from Your Future SelfAn Exercise We Both Use I asked Shay what advice hed give his 25yearold self, and he replied with Maybe I wouldve said, Drop out of college sooner? But I dont think I would change anything. . . . Its easy to think, Well, what would I tell my 25yearold self? So then I think, Well, if Im 45 and Im asked that question, what would I tell my 36yearold self how old Shay is currently? TF This prompted me to share a story with him, which Ill repeat here in brief. I never write fiction, but one of the only pieces of writing Ive lost that made me sad for an extended period was fiction. I wrote a short story about going skiing, retiring to the ski lodge to sip hot chocolate and wine, and ending up seated across the table from a wise old stranger. Several hours of conversation later, this stranger turns out to be my future self. I ask him for advice and he gives me the benefit of his 2020 hindsight. It was a fun story to write, butand this sounds a bit weirdI also got a lot of actionable, specific advice by going through the exercise. When I put my pen down, I was somewhat puzzled and thought, I dont know what I just did there, but it seems like a funky magic trick. I later realized that the story line is similar to a spectacular piece written by Jorge Luis Borges entitled The Other El Otro. When I told Shay this story, his eyes lit up. He jumped in with What you just explained is exactly what I was going to suggest. Think about how old you are right now and think about being a 10yearolder version of yourself. Then think, What would I probably tell myself as an older version of myself? That is the wisdom that I think you found in that exercise. . . . If you do this exercise and then start living the answers, I think youre going to grow exponentially faster than you would have otherwise. Work Will Work When Nothing Else Will Work Shay is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of LatterDay Saints Mormon. On my podcast, he spoke publicly for the first time about battling and overcoming alcoholism Its not easy to get better. Its tough. Our natural inclination is toward addiction and toward the things that are easy. Its easy to drink alcohol and take away the pain. Its easy to not wake up in the morning and exercise. Its easy to go through the drivethrough and buy a Big Mac, right? What are you willing to do that is hard? I remember my Grandpa saying, Work will work when nothing else will work. How Shay Currently Shoots Video Canon PowerShot G7 X camera and Final Cut Pro X. He thinks of his day as 3 acts and films it in thirds morning, afternoon, evening. He captures 10 to 15 minutes total, and he never shoots for more than 2 minutes at a time. Two Approaches to Mood Elevation Shay explained to me how posting daily videos or vlogging video blogging was cheap therapy Physiologically, I could feel my body was different. . . . Just by sitting up straight, putting a smile on my face, and faking it until you make it, you actually do feel better. Theres real power in this. TF This inspired me to experiment with short vlogging for roughly 15 days for mood elevation. I made it as simple as possible, using my iPhone for a 10minute Facebook Live video QA. I uploaded the FB videos to YouTube, and it was incredible how quickly a large repeat viewership formed, something Id never achieved before. As both Casey Neistat page 217 and Shay have explained to me Its about the relationship you build, not the production quality. The effects of acting more upbeat seemed to last at least 2 to 3 hours. Shay has another tactic for mood elevation, probably best used outside of the airport This might sound really crazy, but Ill just look in the mirror and laugh at myself . . . break down this wall of being so pretentious about not being able to be silly. I think theres a great power in not taking things so seriously. Who comes to mind when you hear the word successful? To me, the definition of success is being cool with your parents, your grandparents if still alive, and your kids. Being able to navigate the difficult task of dealing with each other as human beings. Care Bear Stare to 1 Billion Exit Maker Studios just grew like wildfire.

YOU ARE GOING TO DIE! TF CAPS are his. Shay constantly reminds himself of the shortness of life and inevitability of death. I also build memento mori reminders of death into my schedule, whether reading Seneca and other stoicism, spending time with hospice caretakers, visiting graveyards e.g., Omaha Beach, or placing the memoirs of the recently deceased coverout in my living room. If you earn 68K per year, then globally speaking, you are the 1. Will MacAskill Will MacAskill TW willmacaskill, williammacaskill.com is an associate professor of philosophy at Lincoln College, University of Oxford. Just 29 years old, he is likely the youngest associate i.e., tenured professor of philosophy in the world. Will is the author of Doing Good Better and a cofounder of the effective altruism movement. He has pledged to donate everything he earns over 36K per year to whatever charities he believes will be most effective. He has also cofounded two wellknown nonprofits 80,000 Hours, which provides research and advice on how you can best make a difference through your career, and Giving What We Can, which encourages people to commit to give at least 10 of their income to the most effective charities. Between them, they have raised more than 450 million in lifetime pledged donations, and are in the top 1 of nonprofits in terms of growth. You cant make a lousy charity good by having a low overhead. TF Will introduced me to GiveWell.org, a site that conducts indepth research to determine how much nonprofits and foundations actually accomplish in terms of lives saved, lives improved, etc. per dollar spent. This avoids the problem of most other charity rankers, which look at low admin and overhead costs as a flawed proxy for efficient. Of course, if a charity is doing the wrong things, being financially lean means nothing, hence Wills quote. Its all about realworld results. According to GiveWell.org in 2016, three of the most effective and impactful charities are Against Malaria Foundation Deworm the World Initiative Give Directly Two of Wills philosophical role models Peter Singer, Australian moral philosopher and Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University. His most famous works are the surprisingly readable Practical Ethics and Animal Liberation. Derek Parfit, who has spent his entire life at All Souls College at Oxford, which is elite even within Oxford. Derek wrote a book called Reasons and Persons, which Will considers one of the most important books written in the 20th century. Follow Your Passion Is Terrible Advice I think it misconstrues the nature of finding a satisfying career and satisfying job, where the biggest predictor of job satisfaction is mentally engaging work. Its the nature of the job itself. Its not got that much to do with you. . . . Its whether the job provides a lot of variety, gives you good feedback, allows you to exercise autonomy, contributes to the wider worldIs it actually meaningful? Is it making the world better?and also, whether it allows you to exercise a skill that youve developed.

The Dickens ProcessWhat Are Your Beliefs Costing You? The Dickens Process sometimes called the Dickens Pattern is related to A Christmas Carol, written by Charles Dickens. It is one of the exercises I completed over several days at Tony Robbinss Unleash the Power Within UPW event. My friend Navin Thukkaram is a millionaire many times over and lives a charmed life. He has been to UPW 11 times and told me, even if I missed some sessions, I could not miss the live Dickens Process. It was his main reason for attending every year. It serves as his annual upgrade and reboot. This chapter will give you a rough and simplified outline of my experience. In A Christmas Carol, Scrooge is visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. In the Dickens Process, youre forced to examine limiting beliefssay, your top two or three handicapping beliefsacross each tense. Tony guides you through each in depth, and I recall answering and visualizing variations of What has each belief cost you in the past, and what has it cost people youve loved in the past? What have you lost because of this belief? See it, hear it, feel it. What is each costing you and people you care about in the present? See it, hear it, feel it. What will each cost you and people you care about 1, 3, 5, and 10 years from now? See it, hear it, feel it. Why does this appear to work so well? I asked Tony months later, as I saw persistent personal results, and he sent me the following example via audio text If they are coughing like crazy right now from lung cancer, how do they keep smoking? They say to themselves, Well, I smoked for years and it was never a problem. Or they say, It will get better in the future. After all, George Burns lived until 102 smoking cigars. They find the exception to the rule because no one knows what the future is. We can make it up, we can convince ourselves its going to be okay. Or we can remember a past time in which it was okay. Thats how people get out of it. When we feel pain in one time zonemeaning past, present, or futurewe just switch to another time zone rather than change, because change brings so much uncertainty and so much instability and so much fear to people. The Dickens Process doesnt allow you to dodge any time zones. Naturally, its one thing to read about swimming, and another to go swimming. The live process took at least 30 minutes, with Tony on stage and 10,000 people in the audience. I could hear hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people crying. It was the straw that productively broke the camels back of resistance. Confronted with vivid and painful imagery, attendees present company included could no longer rationalize or accept destructive rules in their lives. As Tony put it to me later, There is nothing like a group dynamic of total immersion, when there is nothing around to distract you. Your entire focus is on breaking through and going to the next level, and thats what makes the Dickens Process work. After you feel the acute pain of your current handicapping beliefs, you formulate 2 to 3 replacement beliefs to use moving forward. This is done so that you are not pulled back into old beliefs by old language patterns. One of my top 3 limiting beliefs was Im not hardwired for happiness, which I replaced with Happiness is my natural state. Postevent, I used Scott Adamss page 261 affirmation approach in the mornings to reinforce it. Now, Im well aware how cheesy this all might sound on paper. Nonetheless, I experienced a huge phase shift in my life in the subsequent 3 to 4 weeks. Roughly a year later, I can say this Ive never felt consistently happier in my entire adult life. Perhaps its time for you to take a temporary break from pursuing goals to find the knots in the garden hose that, once removed, will make everything else better and easier?

He is considered one of the most critically acclaimed and visionary storytellers of his generation. Costner has produced, directed, and starred in memorable films such as Dances with Wolves, JFK, The Bodyguard, Field of Dreams, Tin Cup, Bull Durham, Open Range, Hatfields McCoys, and Black or White, among many others. He has been honored with two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and an Emmy Award. He is the coauthor of The Explorers Guild. NearDeath Clarity and Shifting the Burden Kevin described driving to his first real audition for a community theater production of Rumpelstiltskin in an old Datsun pickup. The accelerator broke and dropped to the floor, sending his speedometer from 60 to 80. He saw brake lights up ahead I had my wits about me at one point, halfway through, when I realized I didnt want to die. I threw the clutch in. There was never such a terrible whine but it did engage. . . . I was able to turn the key off, and I coasted to a stop, pulled over into the emergency lane, and didnt kill anybody. I jumped out of that fucking car, hopped over that fence, and hitchhiked to my audition because I wasnt going to miss it. I left it on the freeway. Because I had someplace I wanted to be. I had a place where something was going to happen . . . and, of course, nothing did. I wasnt good enough. I didnt have enough skill. I didnt really know about Rumpelstiltskin. . . . But my imagination started to burn with the possibilities. I started to fall in love with something. Didnt know if I was going to be able to make a living at it, but I finally got rid of the whispers in my head from my parents, which were What are you going to be? And Id say, Its none of your business. Im going to be what I want to be. When I articulated that I didnt care anymore about what anybody thought about what I did except me, all the weight of the world came off my shoulders, and everything became possible. It shifted to everybody else being worried. Now theyre worried. But everything for me, it shifted to a place where I felt free. Let Us Suppose . . . For his role in the film JFK, Kevin didnt want to go too far out on a limb with speculation. He wanted to protect himself and his credibility and came up with an elegant workaround When I came to certain things that I was unsure about, and some other people questioned a little bit, I said, Oliver Stone, Im not comfortable saying this. I would be more comfortable saying, Let us suppose . . . , as opposed to This actually happened. Because the let us suppose is framing things for people to see. Because if theres no actual eyewitness there, you go, Let us suppose this happened. . . . And Oliver didnt fight that at all, to his credit. He said, Thats fine. Lets just paint this picture because thats the picture I believe is there. Taking Chances Kevin described a rare hearttoheart conversation with his dad, who was critical of Kevin becoming an actor. By this point, Kevin was an adult and had succeeded. His dad was sitting in the bathtub He looked at me and he says, You know, I never took a chance in my life. I was almost in my own Field of Dreams moment. There were some tears coming down. He says, I came out of that goddamn fucking Dust Bowl, and when I got a job, Kevin, I didnt want to lose it. I was going to hold on to that, because I knew there would always be food on the table. And I said, There was. There was. There was really kind of just an amazing moment, my dad sitting there. On one level, wisdom is nothing more than the ability to take your own advice. Its actually very easy to give people good advice. Its very hard to follow the advice that you know is good. . . . If someone came to me with my list of problems, I would be able to sort that person out very easily.

I was not prepared for the THC or Sam Harris, and especially not megaTHC and Sam Harris. Morning Routine What you should have in your mind is a picture of controlled chaos. These are not the smoothly oiled gears of a wellcalibrated machine. This is somebody staggering out of his bedroom in search of caffeine, and he may or may not have checked his email before the whistle on the kettle blew. But I do meditate frequently and certainly try to make that every day for 10 to 30 minutes. On Appreciating the Risks of Artificial Intelligence Jaan Tallinn, one of the founders of Skype, said that when he talks to people about this issue, he asks only two questions to get an understanding of whether the person hes talking to is going to be able to grok just how pressing a concern artificial intelligence is. The first is, Are you a programmer?the relevance of which is obviousand the second is, Do you have children? He claims to have found that if people dont have children, their concern about the future isnt sufficiently wellcalibrated so as to get just how terrifying the prospect of building superintelligent machines is in the absence of having figured out the control problem ensuring the AI converges with our interests, even when a thousand or a billion times smarter. I think theres something to that. Its not limited, of course, to artificial intelligence. It spreads to every topic of concern. To worry about the fate of civilization in the abstract is harder than worrying about what sorts of experiences your children are going to have in the future. Exploring SelfTranscendence Buddha and countless contemplatives through the ages can attest to the experience of, for lack of a better phrase, unconditional love. That has some relationship to what I would call selftranscendence, which I think is even more important. So, theres this phenomenon thats clearly deeper than any of our provincial ways of talking about it in the context of religion. Theres a deeper truth of human psychology and the nature of consciousness. I think we need to explore it in terms that dont require that we lie to ourselves or to our children about the nature of reality, and that we dont indulge this divisive language of picking teams in the contest among religions. My book Waking Up is about the phenomenon of selftranscendence and the ways in which people can explore it without believing anything on insufficient evidence. One of the principal ways is through various techniques of meditation, mindfulness being, I think, the most useful one to adopt first. Theres also the use of psychedelic drugs, which is not quite the same as meditation, but it does, if nothing else, reveal that the human nervous system is plastic in a very important way, which means your experience of the world can be radically transformed. Mindfulness and Mental Chatter Mindfulness is just that quality of mind which allows you to pay attention to sights and sounds and sensations, and even thoughts themselves, without being lost in thought and without grasping at what is pleasant and pushing what is unpleasant away. . . . Were so deeply conditioned to be lost in thought and to have this conversation with ourselves from the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep. Its just chatter in the mind, and its so captivating that were not even aware of it. We are essentially in a dream state, and its through this veil of thought that we go about our day and perceive our environment. But we are just talking to ourselves nonstop, and until you can break that spell and begin to notice thoughts themselves as objects of consciousness, just arising and passing away, you cant even pay attention to your breath, or to anything else, with any clarity. What is vipassana meditation? Its simply a method of paying exquisitely close and nonjudgmental attention to whatever youre experiencing anyway.

The Value of Intensive Meditation Retreats In my case, meditation didnt really become useful, which is to say it really didnt become true meditation, until I had sat my first one or two intensive retreats. I remember the experience clearly. Id been very disciplined and had been sitting an hour every day in the morning for a year before I sat my first 10day retreat. I remember looking back over that year at some point, somewhere around the middle of my first 10day vipassana retreat, and realizing that I had just been thinking with my legs crossed every hour that I had practiced that year. This is not to say that this will be true of all of you who are practicing meditation without ever having gone on a retreat, but its very likely true of many of you. . . . A silent retreat is a crucible where you can develop enough energy and attention to break through to another level. . . . On the Power and Liability of Psychedelics In his fantastic and lengthy essay Drugs and the Meaning of Life, Sam wrote If she my daughter does not try a psychedelic like psilocybin or LSD at least once in her adult life, I will worry that she may have missed one of the most important rites of passage a human being can experience . . . a life without drugs is neither foreseeable nor, I think, desirable. I asked him about these lines in our conversation, and he added The caveat is that I have an increasingly healthy respect for what can go wrong on psychedelics, and wrong in a way that I think has lasting consequences. . . . I think theyre still indispensable for a lot of people. They certainly seem to have been indispensable for me. I dont think I ever would have discovered meditation without having taken, in particular, MDMA, but mushrooms and LSD also played a role for me in unveiling an inner landscape that was worth exploring. . . . The sense of being a self riding around in your headthis feeling that everyone calls Iis an illusion that can be disconfirmed in a variety of ways. . . . Its vulnerable to inquiry, and that inquiry can take many forms. The unique power and liability of psychedelics is that they are guaranteed to work in some way. . . . Ethnobotanist Terence McKennas point was, well, if you teach someone to meditate or to do yoga, theres no guarantee whatsoever that something is going to happen. They could spend a week doing it. They could spend a year doing it. Who knows whats going to happen? They may just get bored and wander away, not knowing that there was a there there. If I give you 5 grams of mushrooms or 300 micrograms of LSD and tell you to sit on that couch for an hour, you are guaranteed to have a radical transformation of your experience. It doesnt matter who you are. A freight train of significance is going to come bearing down on you, and we just have to watch the clock, to know when its going to happen. . . . If you have a good experience, youre going to realize that human life can be unutterably sublimethat its possible to feel at home in the universe in a way that you couldnt have previously imagined. But if you have a bad experienceand the bad experiences are every bit as bad as the good experiences are goodyou will have this harrowing encounter with madness. Its as pathological as it is in any lunatic whos wandering the streets, raving to himself and completely cut off from others. You can have that experience, and hopefully it goes away, and in virtually every case, it does go away. But its still rough, and it still has consequences. Some of those consequences are good. I happen to think that it gives you a basis for compassion, in particular for people who are suffering mental illness, that you couldnt otherwise have. Using the Sky for Meditation Look at the sky while meditating. Often my meditation is in the afternoon. I often try to do it outside. If you know anything about Dzogchen, you know that Dzogchen yogis often use the sky as kind of a support for practice. You meditate with your eyes open looking at a clear sky or any place where you can see the horizon. I like to practice that way. I dont always get a chance to do it, but I find that it clears the head in a very useful way. more in Audio Listen to episode 87 of The Tim Ferriss Show fourhourworkweek.com87 for Sams thoughts on the following What books would you recommend everyone read? 655 A thought experiment worth experiencing The Trolley Problem 5525 Caroline Paul Caroline Paul TW carowriter, carolinepaul.com is the author of four published books.

Her latest is the New York Times bestseller The Gutsy Girl Escapades for Your Life of Epic Adventure. Once a young scaredycat, Caroline decided that fear got in the way of the life she wanted. She has since competed on the U.S. National Luge Team in Olympic trials and fought fires as one of the first female firefighters in San Francisco, where she was part of the Rescue 2 group. Rescue 2 members not only fight fires they are also called upon for scuba dive searches i.e., for bodies, rope and rappelling rescues, hazardous material calls, and the most severe car and train accidents. Behind the Scenes Caroline has an identical twin who was a TV superstar on Baywatch. Caroline incorporated a lot of Charles Poliquins page 74 techniques into her weight lifting training, after she met him through Canadian Olympic luger Andre Benoit. Secrets Are a Buffer to Intimacy My dad was superconservative. He voted for Nixon. He still believed that Nixon was a great president up until his death. He definitely was a trueblue Republican. I didnt tell him I was gay for a long time, until my sister said, Why are you keeping secrets? Secrets are a buffer to intimacy. I said, No, he doesnt need to know, and she said, Its a part of your life hes not hearing about, and youre keeping from him. Even though he might not realize it, that is keeping a distance. You need to tell him. She was so right. I told him and was petrified. He was really sweet about it. He was shocked and then sort of struggled and said, Well, I know some gay people. He started listing the gay people he knew. It was really cute. Cooking at the Firehouse The firefighters of Rescue 2 had to take turns cooking food for the rest of the crew There were three tricks. First I remember once, I had a guy come up to me and say, You just dont put any love into this meal. I was so shocked that this big burly firefighter wanted love in his meal, and he was right, actually. I was so sullen about cooking that I didnt. He was a little indignant about that. Now, I try to put love in my meals when I cook. The second was to make it colorful. . . . Its very hard for me to do. Everything was kind of gray. And the third was to have three set meals that you make. Pride Can Be a Tool For me, pride worked because my fear of failure was way greater than my fear of fire. I didnt often feel fear of fire, to be totally frank. Im not trying to pretend Im so brave. Its just that I had a bigger fearhumiliation, failure, letting down women. Pride can be a really great motivator. A book to give every graduating college student? I would say The Things They Carried by Tim OBrien. Its a beautiful book by a writer who fought in Vietnam. That book actually got me back to reading. When you go to college, reading gets kicked out of you a little bit. Putting Fear in Line In the 1990s, Caroline illegally climbed the Golden Gate Bridge, rising to 760 feet on thin cables. Shed mentioned putting fear in line to me, and I asked her to dig into the specifics. I am not against fear. I think fear is definitely important. Its there to keep us safe. But I do feel like some people give it too much priority. Its one of the many things that we use to assess a situation. I am probravery. Thats my paradigm. Fear is just one of many things that are going on. For instance, when we climbed the bridge, which was five of us deciding we wanted to walk up that cable in the middle of the night. Please dont do that, but we did. Talk about fearyoure walking on a cable where you have to put one foot in front of the other until youre basically as high as a 70story building with nothing below you and . . . two thin wires on either side. Its just a walk, technically. Really, nothings going to happen unless some earthquake or catastrophic gust of wind hits. Youre going to be fine as long as you keep your mental state intact. In those situations, I look at all the emotions Im feeling, which are anticipation, exhilaration, focus, confidence, fun, and fear. Then I take fear and say, Well, how much priority am I going to give this? I really want to do this. I put it where it belongs. Its like brick laying or making a stone wall. You fit the pieces together. TIM Have you visualized the bricks? To someone who doesnt have'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

What would you advise them to do? CAROLINE I actually want someone to partition each emotion as if its a little separate block and then put it in a line. Once you assess your own skill and the situation, often things change. As long as you stop and really look, I think peoples lives will change kind of radically, especially for women. Women are very, very quick to say theyre scared. Thats something I really want to change. Encouraging Girls On common parenting differences when raising sons and daughters With boys, there is an active encouragementdespite the possibility that they could get hurtand guiding the son to do it, often on his own. When a daughter decides to do something that might have some risk involved, after cautioning her, the parents are much more likely to assist her in doing it. What is this telling girls? Theyre fragile and they need our help. That is acculturated so early. So of course, by the time were women and in the workplace or relationships, thats going to be a predominant paradigm for us fear. TIM For women who are listening and say to themselves, My God. Shes totally right. I was raised in a bubble of sorts. I dont want to have this default anymore. I want to condition myself to be able to contend with fear and put it in line. What would you say to them? CAROLINE I would say its time to adopt a paradigm of bravery instead of a paradigm of fear. So, when you have a boy and a girl, or a man and a woman, facing the exact same situation, there will be two emotional reactions to it that are sort of opposite. The man will be trying to access his bravery, and the woman will be accessing her fear. TIM This really underscores something important. Courage takes practice. Its a skill you have to develop. I feel like a coward sometimes. Were sitting here in my house and doing this interview, and on my coffee table is a quote on a piece of driftwood from Anas Nin. It says, Life shrinks or expands in proportion to ones courage. I literally have this on my coffee table so I see it every single day. Fragility Is Overrated I hope no one gets injured, but injury is not as bad as people think. To not do something because you might get injured is a terrible reason not to do something. We can get injured in anything. Just getting into your car is very dangerous. I think we should just put that in its place. Girls are often told, Oh, you could get hurt, and the specter of getting hurt takes on these huge proportions. For boys, thats not emphasized. And yet, girls and boys are physically the same before puberty. They break the same, and theyre as able as each other, if not girls being more able at that time. The fact that girls are told and treated as if theyre more fragile doesnt make sense at all. It primes them to be very overcautious. . . . TF Two of my favorite lines from Carolines writing are from her New York Times OpEd piece titled Why Do We Teach Girls That Its Cute to Be Scared? . . . By cautioning girls away from these experiences, we are not protecting them. We are woefully underpreparing them for life.

His sneakers gripped firmly on the jagged rock, and he drove his chest forward toward 3,000 feet of nothing. He held his breath on the final step, and the panic drove him to nearunconsciousness. His vision blurred at the edges, closing to a single pinpoint of light, and then . . . he floated. The allconsuming celestial blue of the horizon hit his visual field an instant after he realized that the thermal updraft had caught him and the wings of the paraglider. Fear was behind him on the mountaintop, and thousands of feet above the resplendent green rainforest and pristine white beaches of Copacabana, Hans Keeling had seen the light. That was Sunday. On Monday, Hans returned to his law office in Century City, Los Angeless posh corporate haven, and promptly handed in his 3week notice. For nearly 5 years, he had faced his alarm clock with the same dread I have to do this for another 40 to 45 years? He had once slept under his desk at the office after a punishing halfdone project, only to wake up and continue on it the next morning. That same morning, he had made himself a promise Two more times and Im out of here. Strike number three came the day before he left for his Brazilian vacation. We all make these promises to ourselves, and Hans had done it before as well, but things were now somehow different. He was different. He had realized something while arcing in slow circles toward the earthrisks werent that scary once you took them. His colleagues told him what he expected to hear He was throwing it all away. He was an attorney on his way to the topwhat the hell did he want? Hans didnt know exactly what he wanted, but he had tasted it. On the other hand, he did know what bored him to tears, and he was done with it. No more passing days as the living dead, no more dinners where his colleagues compared cars, riding on the sugar high of a new BMW purchase until someone bought a more expensive Mercedes. It was over. Immediately, a strange shift beganHans felt, for the first time in a long time, at peace with himself and what he was doing. He had always been terrified of plane turbulence, as if he might die with the best inside of him, but now he could fly through a violent storm sleeping like a baby. Strange indeed. More than a year later, he was still getting unsolicited job offers from law firms, but by then had started Nexus Surf, a premier surf adventure company based in the tropical paradise of Florianopolis, Brazil. He had met his dream girl, a Carioca with caramelcolored skin named Tatiana, and spent most of his time relaxing under palm trees or treating clients to the best times of their lives. Is this what he had been so afraid of? These days, he often sees his former self in the underjoyed and overworked professionals he takes out on the waves. Waiting for the swell, the true emotions come out God, I wish I could do what you do. His reply is always the same You can. The setting sun reflects off the surface of the water, providing a Zenlike setting for a message he knows is true Its not giving up to put your current path on indefinite pause. He could pick up his law career exactly where he left off if he wanted to, but that is the furthest thing from his mind. As they paddle back to shore after an awesome session, his clients get a hold of themselves and regain their composure. They set foot on shore, and reality sinks its fangs in I would, but I cant really throw it all away. He has to laugh. The Power of Pessimism Defining the Nightmare Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action. Benjamin Disraeli, former British Prime Minister To do or not to do? To try or not to try? Most people will vote no, whether they consider themselves brave or not. Uncertainty and the prospect of failure can be very scary noises in the shadows. Most people will choose unhappiness over uncertainty. For years, I set goals, made resolutions to change direction, and nothing came of either. I was just as insecure and scared as the rest of the world. The simple solution came to me accidentally in 2004. At that time, I had more money than I knew what to do with, and I was completely miserable, worse than ever. I had no time and was working myself to death. I had started my own company, only to realize it would be nearly impossible to sell. Oops. I felt trapped and stupid at the same time. I should be able to figure this out, I thought. Why am I such an idiot? Why cant I make this work?! Buckle up and stop being such a insert expletive! Whats wrong with me? The truth was, nothing was wrong with me. Critical mistakes made in the companys infancy would never let me sell it. I could hire magic elves and connect my brain to a supercomputerit didnt matter. My little baby had some serious birth defects. This turned out to be yet another selfimposed limitation and false construct.

My little baby had some serious birth defects. This turned out to be yet another selfimposed limitation and false construct. BrainQUICKEN was acquired by a private equity firm in 2009, which I discuss more in RealWorld MBA on page 250. The question then became, How do I free myself from this Frankenstein while making it selfsustaining? How do I pry myself from the tentacles of workaholism and the fear that it would fall to pieces without my 15hour days? How do I escape this selfmade prison? A trip, I decided. A sabbatical year around the world. So I took the trip, right? Well, Ill get to that. First, I felt it prudent to dance around with my shame, embarrassment, and anger for 6 months, all the while playing an endless loop of reasons why my copout fantasy trip could never work. One of my more productive periods, for sure. Then, one day, in my bliss of envisioning how bad my future suffering would be, I hit upon a gem of an idea. It was surely a highlight of my dont happy, be worry phase Why dont I decide exactly what my nightmare would bethe worst thing that could possibly happen as a result of my trip? Well, my business could fail while Im overseas, obviously. Probably would. A legal warning letter would accidentally not get forwarded, and I would get sued. My business would be shut down, and inventory would spoil on the shelves while Im picking my toes in solitary misery on some cold shore in Ireland. Crying in the rain, I imagine. My bank account would crater by 80 and certainly my car and motorcycle in storage would be stolen. I suppose someone would probably spit on my head from a highrise balcony while Im feeding food scraps to a stray dog, which would then spook and bite me squarely on the face. God, life is a cruel, hard bitch. Conquering Fear Defining Fear Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while Is this the condition that I feared? Seneca Then a funny thing happened. In my undying quest to make myself miserable, I accidentally began to backpedal. As soon as I cut through the vague unease and ambiguous anxiety by defining my nightmare, the worstcase scenario, I wasnt as worried about taking a trip. Suddenly, I started thinking of simple steps I could take to salvage my remaining resources and get back on track if all hell struck at once. I could always take a temporary bartending job to pay the rent if I had to. I could sell some furniture and cut back on eating out. I could steal lunch money from the kindergarteners who passed by my apartment every morning. The options were many. I realized it wouldnt be that hard to get back to where I was, let alone survive. None of these things would be fatalnot even close. Mere panty pinches on the journey of life. I realized that on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being nothing and 10 being permanently lifechanging, my socalled worstcase scenario might have a temporary impact of 3 or 4. I believe this is true of most people and most wouldbe holy sht, my life is over disasters. Keep in mind that this is the oneinamillion disaster nightmare. On the other hand, if I realized my bestcase scenario, or even a probablecase scenario, it would easily have a permanent 9 or 10 positive lifechanging effect. In other words, I was risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a probable and permanent 9 or 10, and I could easily recover my baseline workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I wanted to. This all equated to a significant realization There was practically no risk, only huge lifechanging upside potential, and I could resume my previous course without any more effort than I was already putting forth. That is when I made the decision to take the trip and bought a oneway ticket to Europe. I started planning my adventures and eliminating my physical and psychological baggage. None of my disasters came to pass, and my life has been a nearfairy tale since. The business did better than ever, and I practically forgot about it as it financed my travels around the world in style for 15 months.

Write down your answers, and keep in mind that thinking a lot will not prove as fruitful or as prolific as simply brainvomiting on the page. Write and do not editaim for volume. Spend a few minutes on each answer. Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering. What doubt, fears, and whatifs pop up as you consider the big changes you canor need tomake? Envision them in painstaking detail. Would it be the end of your life? What would be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale of 1 to 10? Are these things really permanent? How likely do you think it is that they would actually happen? What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if temporarily? Chances are, its easier than you imagine. How could you get things back under control? What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios? Now that youve defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive outcomes, whether internal confidence, selfesteem, etc. or external? What would the impact of these morelikely outcomes be on a scale of 1 to 10? How likely is it that you could produce at least a moderately good outcome? Have less intelligent people done this before and pulled it off? If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control? Imagine this scenario and run through questions 1 to 3 above. If you quit your job to test other options, how could you later get back on the same career track if you absolutely had to? What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to do. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might beit is fear of unknown outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do it. Ill repeat something you might consider tattooing on your forehead What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a persons success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and famous businesspeople for advice. What is it costing youfinancially, emotionally, and physicallyto postpone action? Dont only evaluate the potential downside of action. It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction. If you dont pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years? How will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you and having allowed 10 more years of your finite life to pass doing what you know will not fulfill you? If you telescope out 10 years and know with 100 certainty that it is a path of disappointment and regret, and if we define risk as the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome, inaction is the greatest risk of all. What are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without resorting to the BS concept of good timing, the answer is simple Youre afraid, just like the rest of the world. Measure the cost of inaction, realize the unlikelihood and repairability of most missteps, and develop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so action.

As part of the last, hes investigating how to revive and restore endangered or extinct species, including the woolly mammoth. He might be the realworld most interesting man in the world. Behind the Scenes I attended the very first Quantified Self meetup on September 10, 2008, at Kevins picturesque wood cabinstyle home. From that small, 28person gathering, QS has grown into a popculture term and international phenomenon, with organizations in more than 20 countries. Sit, Sit. Walk, Walk. Dont Wobble. The Zen mantra is Sit, sit. Walk, walk. Dont wobble. . . . Its this idea that when Im with a person, thats total priority. Anything else is multitasking. No, no, no, no. The peopletopeople, persontoperson trumps anything else. I have given my dedication to this. If I go to a play or a movie, I am at the movie. I am not anywhere else. Its 100I am going to listen. If I go to a conference, I am going to go to the conference. TF This is very similar to Derek Siverss page 184 Dont be a donkey rule. In a world of distraction, singletasking is a superpower. The Death Countdown Clock I actually have a countdown clock that Matt Groening at Futurama was inspired by, and they did a little episode of Futurama about it. I took the actuarial tables for the estimated age of my death, for someone born when I was born, and I worked back the number of days. I have that showing on my computer, how many days. I tell you, nothing concentrates your time like knowing how many days you have left. Now, of course, Im likely to live longer than that. Im in good health, etc. But nonetheless, I have 6,000something days. Its not very many days to do all the things I want to do. I learned something from my friend Stewart Brand founder of the Whole Earth Catalog, president of the Long Now Foundation, who organized his remaining days around 5year increments. He says any great idea thats significant, thats worth doing, for him, will last about 5 years, from the time he thinks of it, to the time he stops thinking about it. And if you think of it in terms of 5year projects, you can count those off on a couple hands, even if youre young. TF One massively successful private equity investor I know uses an Excel spreadsheet to display his own death countdown clock. Memento moriremember that youre going to die. Its a great way to remember to live. One manual project that every human should experience? You need to build your own house, your own shelter. Its not that hard to do, believe me. I built my own house. Write to Get Ideas, Not to Express Them What I discovered, which is what many writers discover, is that I write in order to think. Id say, I think I have an idea, but when I begin to write it, I realize, I have no idea, and I dont actually know what I think until I try and write it. . . . That was the revelation. The Problem with Being Nostradamus Kevin has an incredible track record of predicting tech innovations and trends. Its a blessing and a curse The dilemma is that any true forecast about the future is going to be dismissed. Any future that is believable now is going to be wrong, and so youre stuck. If people believe it, its wrong, and if they dont believe it, where does it get you? TF One of his tools for coming up with unbelievable yet ultimately accurate predictions is making a list of what everyone thinks is true or will be true, and asking What if that werent true? for each, brainstorming the ramifications. Can You Flip the DeferredLife Plan and Make It Work? Many, many people are working very hard, trying to save their money to retire so they can travel. Well, I decided to flip it around and travel when I was really young, when I had zero money. And I had experiences that, basically, even a billion dollars couldnt have bought. You Dont Want Premature Optimization I really recommend slack. Productive is for your middle ages. When youre young, you want to be prolific and make and do things, but you dont want to measure them in terms of productivity. You want to measure them in terms of extreme performance, you want to measure them in extreme satisfaction. The Ideas You Cant Give Away or Kill . . . I became a proponent of trying to give things away first. Tell everybody what youre doing . . . you try to give these ideas away, and people are happy, because they love great ideas. Ill give it to them and say, Hey, its a great idea. You should do it. Id try to give everything away first, and then Id try to kill everything else. Its the ones that keep coming back that I cant kill and I cant give away, that make me think, Hmmm, maybe thats the one Im supposed to do. TF Kevin Rose page 340 does EXACTLY the same thing. Ive seen him do it dozens of times. Create a New Slot The great temptation that people have is they want to be someone else, they want to be in someone elses movie. They want to be the best rock star, and there are so many of those already that you can only wind up imitating somebody in that slot. To me, success is you make your own slot. You have a new slot that didnt exist before. Thats, of course, what Jesus and many others were doing. Thats really hard to do, but I think thats what I chalk up as success.

The Worst Case A Sleeping Bag and Oatmeal One of the many life skills that you want to learn at a fairly young age is the skill of being an ultrathrifty, minimal kind of little wisp thats traveling through time . . . in the sense of learning how little you actually need to live, not just in a survival mode, but in a contented mode. . . . That gives you the confidence to take a risk, because you say, Whats the worst that can happen? Well, the worst that can happen is that Id have a backpack and a sleeping bag, and Id be eating oatmeal. And Id be fine. Is This What I So Feared? Our life is frittered away by detail. . . . Simplify, simplify. . . . A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone. Henry David Thoreau, Walden Fearsetting page 463 is one instrument in the toolbox of conquering fear. Another of my favorites is fearrehearsingregularly microdosing myself with the worstcase scenario as inoculation. One exchange with Jocko Willink page 412 explains the value of planned exposure to the bad TIM How do you prepare people and condition them, so that they can actually function when the shit starts hitting the fan? JOCKO The SEAL Teams do a very good job of desensitizing you to horrible situations so that you can deal with it when it comes. The following is an excerpt from On Festivals and Fasting, letter 18 from The Moral Letters to Lucilius, which Seneca wrote to his pupil Lucilius. The source text is the Loeb Classics translation by Richard Mott Gummere of Senecas Moral Letters to Lucilius, vol. 1 Harvard University Press, 1917. I reread letter 18 often. Half of the time, you will realize that the horrible isnt so horrible, and when it is, you can make it less so with repeated exposure. After Senecas writing, Ive included a few examples of how I personally implement this Enter Seneca I am so firmly determined to test the constancy of your mind Lucilius that, drawing from the teachings of great men, I shall give you also a lesson Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while Is this the condition that I feared? It is precisely in times of immunity from care that the soul should toughen itself beforehand for occasions of greater stress, and it is while Fortune is kind that it should fortify itself against her violence. In days of peace the soldier performs maneuvers, throws up earthworks with no enemy in sight, and wearies himself by gratuitous toil, in order that he may be equal to unavoidable toil. If you would not have a man flinch when the crisis comes, train him before it comes. Such is the course which those men have followed who, in their imitation of poverty, have every month come almost to want, that they might never recoil from what they had so often rehearsed. You need not suppose that I mean meals like Timons, or paupers huts, or any other device which luxurious millionaires use to beguile the tedium of their lives. Let the pallet be a real one, and the cloak coarse let the bread be hard and grimy. Endure all this for three or four days at a time, sometimes for more, so that it may be a test of yourself instead of a mere hobby. Then, I assure you, my dear Lucilius, you will leap for joy when filled with a pennyworth of food, and you will understand that a mans peace of mind does not depend upon Fortune for, even when angry, she grants enough for our needs. How might you put this into practice? Here are a few things Ive done repeatedly for 3 to 14 days at a time to simulate losing all my money Sleeping in a sleeping bag, whether on my living room floor or outside Wearing cheap white shirts and a single pair of jeans for the entire 3 to 14 days Using CouchSurfing.com or a similar service to live in hosts homes for free, even if in your own city Eating only A instant oatmeal andor B rice and beans Drinking only water and cheap instant coffee or tea Cooking'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

She is executive producer and, along with Michael Patrick King, cocreator of the Emmynominated CBS comedy 2 Broke Girls. She has headlined with comics including Sarah Silverman, Louis C.K., Amy Schumer, Aziz Ansari, and others. Her first 1hour standup special, Whitney Cummings Money Shot, premiered on Comedy Central in 2010 and was nominated for an American Comedy Award. Her second standup special, Whitney Cummings I Love You, debuted on Comedy Central in 2014 and her latest special, Whitney Cummings Im Your Girlfriend, premiered on HBO. LittleKnown Fact Both Whitney and Josh Waitzkin page 577 recommend the book The Drama of the Gifted Child by Alice Miller. In Order for Art to Imitate Life, You Have to Have a Life In intensive therapy, similar to trauma therapy, I had to replace a negative thought with a positive thought for 28 days. I got really worried. I was talking to my therapist and a bunch of people in my program, and I said, Im just really afraid that Im not going to be as funny if Im not as dark and in pain all the time. It turned out to be the opposite, because I waste so much time trying to manage unhealthy relationships and having low selfesteem, and my perfectionism can be paralyzing. Perfectionism leads to procrastination, which leads to paralysis. I could go a couple of days without getting any writing done, because my selfesteem was too low. I didnt think I was good enough. Just these old, obsolete messages and survival instincts. Doing the work and therapy has given me so much more mental energy, physical energy. I have much more balance in my life now, and Im much more productive and much more vulnerable. As a writer, you have to be vulnerable. Before, I was so overworked, I was such a chronic workaholic that I didnt have a life. And in order for art to imitate life, you have to have a life. TIM Thats a really profound statement. WHITNEY For me, art was imitating art because all I was doing was working. PeoplePleasing Is a Form of Assholery Whitney wrote, produced and starred in Whitney, which aired on NBC from 2011 to 2013 I was so apologetic and afraid of people not liking me, that . . . I slowed down the writing process and confused employees. In the room, people would pitch jokes, and I would just say yes to all of them, because I didnt want to hurt anyones feelings. Id have to go later and change them, and thenall of a suddenthe script comes out and their jokes arent there, and they feel betrayed and lied to. When I first went in to AlAnon support group for addiction I heard someone say, Peoplepleasing is a form of assholery, which I just loved, because youre not pleasing anybody. Youre just making them resentful because youre being disingenuous, and youre also not giving them the dignity of their own experience and assuming they cant handle the truth. Its patronizing. TF After this conversation with Whitney I reread Lying by Sam Harris. The types of white lies Whitney describes can be hugely destructive, and Sam makes a compelling case for stopping the use of a wide spectrum of halftruths. Codependence is often used incorrectly. Its when you look to other people to decide how you are feeling. Start with I Love You During the first few minutes of our interview at a friends kitchen table, I noticed very faint tattoos on Whitneys arm. It turns out they were done with white ink. I have a white tattoo on my lower left forearm that says I love you, and I dont think anyone has ever noticed it without me having to point it out. . .'], 'model': 'text-embedding-3-small', 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}

When I first went in to AlAnon support group for addiction I heard someone say, Peoplepleasing is a form of assholery, which I just loved, because youre not pleasing anybody. Youre just making them resentful because youre being disingenuous, and youre also not giving them the dignity of their own experience and assuming they cant handle the truth. Its patronizing. TF After this conversation with Whitney I reread Lying by Sam Harris. The types of white lies Whitney describes can be hugely destructive, and Sam makes a compelling case for stopping the use of a wide spectrum of halftruths. Codependence is often used incorrectly. Its when you look to other people to decide how you are feeling. Start with I Love You During the first few minutes of our interview at a friends kitchen table, I noticed very faint tattoos on Whitneys arm. It turns out they were done with white ink. I have a white tattoo on my lower left forearm that says I love you, and I dont think anyone has ever noticed it without me having to point it out. . . . I was struggling a little bit with patience and compassion. Again, Im codependent. I grew up in an alcoholic home. . . . How we survived as children was by exerting control whenever possible, as though if I could just organize my drinks in the right row, Im going to be fine. As an adult I found myself getting frustrated with people not doing things my way. . . . I dont like the way youre doing things, I dont like the way youre saying that, I dont like the way youre sitting just everything . . . Is he wearing flipflops to work? It was just a way to not focus on myself. And I think ultimately, sometimes when we judge other people, its just a way to not look at ourselves a way to feel superior or sanctimonious or whatever. My trauma therapist said every time you meet someone, just in your head say, I love you before you have a conversation with them, and that conversation is going to go a lot better. Its just an interesting little trick. For 28 days, when I met someone, whether its the lady at the DMV whos making me wait 2 hours or someone else, I would just assume everybody is doing the best they can with what they have, which is really hard for a lot of us to accept. Its All Material When I first had moneyI grew up without any moneyI got a car. . . . It was a Lexus hybrid, and the first day I got it, I filled it up with diesel fuel. I destroyed it. It was awful. I got this great joke out of it, though, a 7minute bit that probably paid for all the damage. So now, Im in this place where when something bad happens, I think Oh, good, I can use that. TF I recently spotted a Tshirt in Manhattan that read bad decisions make good stories. Look for the silver lining, or at least consider sharing the dark lining. It might pay for your Lexus. Break Your Heart Open, Buy a House There is a difference between getting your heart broken and getting your heart broken open. When it gets broken open, thats where the meat is. Thats where you write great characters. Thats how you get vulnerable, and its important. As comedians, we pride ourselves on how tough we are, but were porcupines. Under there, its all marshmallow. And thats where the gold is. . . . I remember sharing in an AlAnon meeting something that really hurt my feelings. I said He did this, and then he did this . . . and people started laughing. I realized, Oh, my God, this is funny because its happened to other people, and people are relating and its resonating. When you tell the truth about your embarrassing moments and show your shadow, a catharsis happens, which is what laughter is. I promise, if you just tell the truth and get your heart broken as a comedian, you will have a house. The Material Is 10 of It TIM If you had 8 weeks to get someone ready to do 5 minutes on stage at an open mic, what would you do? WHITNEY I would get them on stage the first night and every night for all of the 8 weeks, whether they have material or not. . . . The material is like 10 of it. Being comfortable on stage is all of it. So I would say, just get on stage. The first year and a half, two years of standup is just getting comfortable on stage. Your material doesnt matter. . . . It took me a long time to realize that as soon as you get on stage, you need to address what the audience is already thinking. . . . I dont know who said this quote, but Comedians become comedians so they can control why people laugh at them. The first couple of years, I had to address the last name Cummings in the beginning. Everyone was then like Cool, we dont have to think about this anymore. Because people were like Did she just say Cummings? Is her last name Cummings? and then theyre distracted. So you have to take it off the table. Can we move on here? Okay, my last name is Cummings, now lets get to some other stuff. TF See Neil Strausss related strategy for haterproofing on page 348.

Louis C.K. says, If you think about something more than three times a week, you have to write about it. Whitneys Definition of Love My definition of love is being willing to die for someone who you yourself want to kill. That, in my experience, is kind of the deal. Equine Therapy One of the most fascinating things Whitney introduced me to was equine therapy, which entails walking a horse across an enclosure with no bridle, solely using body language and intention. She did this at The Reflective Horse in the Santa Monica mountains in Southern California. The first thing you do is you pick a horse. There are four horses, all with various degrees of damage. She tells you about each one, and you choose your horse, which already says everything that she needs to know about you. Its like a Rorschach test. Then, the first objective is get the horse from one end of the corral to the other, which is probably half a football field. So Im thinking, How do you get a horse with no reins from one end to the other without controlling it? You cant use treats. I cant use charm, I cant use humor, I cant use intelligence I cant use any of the things I rely on on a daily basis to manipulate and beguile people. Essentially, you have to use your intention. So, you let them know, Were going to the other end. You can use words if you want. As long as youre saying something and meaning it, theyre going to buy it. Its a way to practice being present and connected and having a consistent intention with these animals that are basically a mirror for your psyche. . . . Ive almost learned more from that than any other book or therapy Ive ever done. . . . Equine therapy is so fascinating because of what comes up, the way that we relate to horses says so much about the how we try to run businesses, marriages, relationships. Its a metaphor for everything, because the way you do anything is the way you do everything. Making Coffee like a Slave I do it with almond milk and allnatural sugar. I had this woman come in and take all the carcinogens out of my house, so Im making my own almond milk like an Amish slave these days. Damn, That Neil Gaimans Good Whitney and I both love Neil Gaimans Make Good Art commencement speech, which he gave at Philadelphias University of the Arts. Ive watched the video dozens of times on YouTube during rough periods. Our mutual favorite portion is The moment that you feel that, just possibly, youre walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. Thats the moment you may be starting to get it right. And, yes, I know Ive mentioned this before. It bears repeating. Who does Whitney think of as a standup comedy monster, a true master? Bill Burr.

The Three Things You Cant Fake There are three things you cant really fake one is fighting, the second is sex, and the third is comedy. It doesnt matter who your publicist is or how famous you are, manif you dont bring the money, it gets quiet in that room fast. Asking Personal Questions for Longevity in Comedy I think the way to write standup, if you want longevity in this business, at least for me, is to start by asking yourself personal questions. I write from this. I ask myself what Im afraid of, what Im ashamed of, who Im pretending to be, who I really am, where I am versus where I thought Id be. . . .

He is voracious, and I often ask him for book recommendations. Illusionist David Blaine credits Bryan with being the first person to get him to read extensively. They met when Blaine was in theater school, and Bryan told him The difference between the people you admire and everybody else is that the former are the people who read. Here are a few of Bryans favorites I remember reading Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand. Thats good fodder for a young man. It sets these bold, stark charactersyou could even call them Christ figuresand you think to yourself, I want to be that. Of course, I read Nietzsche. On the Genealogy of Morality, etc., where the truths and truisms are really cut and dried in a lot of ways. Its the equivalent of, I guess, intellectual red meat. But then I got into Joseph CampbellThe Power of Myth and The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Joseph Campbell was the first person to really open my eyes to the compassionate side of life, or of thought. . . . Campbell was the guy who really kind of put it all together for me, and not in a way I could put my finger on. . . . It made you just glad to be alive, realizing how vast this world is, and how similar and how different we are. Mostgifted or recommended books? Youre going to think Im plugging you, but I probably have recommended The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin, page 577 and The 4Hour Body, Im not kidding, more than any other books. What Would You Say in a College Commencement Speech? Well, I would say that if you are searching for status, and if you are doing things because theres an audience for it, youre probably barking up the wrong tree. I would say, Listen to yourself. Follow your bliss, and Joseph Campbell, to bring it back around, said, There is great security in insecurity. We are wired and programmed to do whats safe and whats sensible. I dont think thats the way to go. I think you do things because they are just things you have to do, or because its a calling, or because youre idealistic enough to think that you can make a difference in the world. I think you should try to slay dragons. I dont care how big the opponent is. We read about and admire the people who did things that were basically considered to be impossible. Thats what makes the world a better place to live. When people seem like they are mean, theyre almost never mean. Theyre anxious. Alain de Botton Alain de Botton TW alaindebotton, alaindebotton.com is many things, but I think of him as a rare breed of practical philosopher. In 1997, he turned away from writing novels and instead wrote an extended essay titled How Proust Can Change Your Life, which became an unlikely blockbuster. His subsequent books have been described as a philosophy of everyday life and include Essays in Love, Status Anxiety, The Architecture of Happiness, The News A Users Manual, and Art as Therapy. In 2008, Alain helped start The School of Life in London, a social enterprise determined to make learning and therapy relevant in modern culture. Dont Attribute to Malice That Which Can Be Explained Otherwise Wasnt it Bill Clinton who said that when dealing with anyone whos upset, he always asks, Has this person slept? Have they eaten? Is somebody else bugging them? He goes through this simple checklist. . . . When were handling babies and the baby is kicking and crying, we almost never once say, That babys out to get me or Shes got evil intentions. Success Must Include Peace The very word success has become contaminated by our ideas of someone extraordinary, very rich, etc., and thats really unhelpful. . . . Ultimately, to be properly successful is to be at peace as well. Offense Versus Defense The more you know what you really want, and where youre really going, the more what everybody else is doing starts to diminish. The moments when your own path is at its most ambiguous, thats when the voices of others, the distracting chaos in which we live, the social media static start to loom large and become very threatening.

Success Must Include Peace The very word success has become contaminated by our ideas of someone extraordinary, very rich, etc., and thats really unhelpful. . . . Ultimately, to be properly successful is to be at peace as well. Offense Versus Defense The more you know what you really want, and where youre really going, the more what everybody else is doing starts to diminish. The moments when your own path is at its most ambiguous, thats when the voices of others, the distracting chaos in which we live, the social media static start to loom large and become very threatening. Dont Expect Others to Understand You To blame someone for not understanding you fully is deeply unfair because, first of all, we dont understand ourselves, and even if we do understand ourselves, we have such a hard time communicating ourselves to other people.

The Problem with Most Modern Philosophers Nowadays, philosophers tend to only be employed by universities. . . . When no one will pay directly for your subject matter, thats often a sign that somethings gone wrong. . . . Philosophers generally dont tell us how to live and die anymore. There are only a few. Which philosophers would Alain suggest for practical living? Alains list overlaps nearly 100 with my own Epicurus, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, Plato, Michel de Montaigne, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Bertrand Russell. Mostgifted or recommended books? The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera, Essays of Michel de Montaigne. Favorite documentary The Up series This ongoing series is filmed in the UK, and revisits the same group of people every 7 years. It started with their 7th birthdays Seven Up! and continues up to present day, when they are in their 50s. Subjects were picked from a wide variety of social backgrounds. Alain calls these very undramatic and quietly powerful films probably the best documentary that exists. TF This is also the favorite of Stephen Dubner on page 574. Stephen says, If you are at all interested in any kind of science or sociology, or human decisionmaking, or nurture versus nature, it is the best thing ever. Advice to your 30yearold self? I would have said, Appreciate whats good about this moment. Dont always think that youre on a permanent journey. Stop and enjoy the view. . . . I always had this assumption that if you appreciate the moment, youre weakening your resolve to improve your circumstances. Thats not true, but I think when youre young, its sort of associated with that. . . . I had people around me whod say things like, Oh, a flower, nice. A little part of me was thinking, You absolute loser. Youve taken time to appreciate a flower? Do you not have bigger plans? I mean, this the limit of your ambition? and when lifes knocked you around a bit and when youve seen a few things, and time has happened and youve got some years under your belt, you start to think more highly of modest things like flowers and a pretty sky, or just a morning where nothings wrong and everyones been pretty nice to everyone else. . . . Fortune can do anything with us. We are very fragile creatures. You only need to tap us or hit us in slightly the wrong place. . . . You only have to push us a little bit, and we crack very easily, whether thats the pressure of disgrace or physical illness, financial pressure, etc. It doesnt take very much. So, we do have to appreciate every day that goes by without a major disaster. Lazy A Manifesto Tim Kreider timkreider.com is an essayist and cartoonist. His most recent book is We Learn Nothing, which I loved so much that I reached out to Tim, and we produced the audiobook together. The essay that follows is excerpted from that book. He has contributed to the New York Times, the New Yorker, Mens Journal, the Comics Journal, Film Quarterly, and others. His cartoons have been collected in three books by Fantagraphics. He lives in New York City in an undisclosed location on the Chesapeake Bay. He had the same cat for 19 years. Enter Tim Kreider If you live in America in the 21st century youve probably had to listen to a lot of people tell you how busy they are. Its become the default response when you ask anyone how theyre doing Busy! So busy. Crazy busy. It is, pretty obviously, a boast disguised as a complaint. And the stock response is a kind of congratulation Thats a good problem to have, or Better than the opposite. This frantic, selfcongratulatory busyness is a distinctly upscale affliction. Notice it isnt generally people pulling backtoback shifts in the ICU, taking care of their senescent parents, or holding down three minimumwage jobs they have to commute to by bus who need to tell you how busy they are what those people are is not busy but tired. Exhausted. Dead on their feet. Its most often said by people whose lamented busyness is purely selfimposed work and obligations theyve taken on voluntarily, classes and activities theyve encouraged their kids to participate in. Theyre busy because of their own ambition or drive or anxiety, because they are addicted to busyness and dread what they might have to face in its absence. Almost everyone I know is busy. They feel anxious and guilty when they arent working or doing something to promote their work.

I recently wrote a friend asking if he wanted to do something this week, and he answered that he didnt have a lot of time but if something was going on to let him know and maybe he could ditch work for a few hours. My question had not a preliminary headsup to some future invitation This was the invitation. I was hereby asking him to do something with me. But his busyness was like some vast churning noise through which he was shouting out at me, and I gave up trying to shout back over it. I recently learned a neologism that, like political correctness, man cave, and contentprovider, I instantly recognized as heralding an ugly new turn in the culture planshopping. That is, deferring committing to any one plan for an evening until you know what all your options are, and then picking the one thats most likely to be funadvance your careerhave the most girls at itin other words, treating people like menu options or products in a catalog. Even children are busy now, scheduled down to the half hour with enrichment classes, tutorials, and extracurricular activities. At the end of the day they come home as tired as grownups, which seems not just sad but hateful. I was a member of the latchkey generation, and had three hours of totally unstructured, largely unsupervised time every afternoon, time I used to do everything from scouring The World Book Encyclopedia to making animated movies to convening with friends in the woods in order to chuck dirt clods directly into one anothers eyes, all of which afforded me knowledge, skills, and insights that remain valuable to this day. This busyness is not a necessary or inevitable condition of life its something weve chosen, if only by our acquiescence to it. I recently Skyped with a friend who had been driven out of New York City by the rents and now has an artists residency in a small town in the South of France. She described herself as happy and relaxed for the first time in years. She still gets her work done, but it doesnt consume her entire day and brain. She says it feels like collegeshe has a circle of friends there who all go out to the caf or watch TV together every night. She has a boyfriend again. She once ruefully summarized dating in New York Everyone is too busy and everyone thinks they can do better. What she had mistakenly assumed was her personalitydriven, cranky, anxious, and sadturned out to be a deformative effect of her environment, of the crushing atmospheric pressure of ambition and competitiveness. Its not as if any of us wants to live like this, any more than any one person wants to be part of a traffic jam or stadium trampling or the hierarchy of cruelty in high school its something we collectively force one another to do. It may not be a problem thats soluble through any social reform or selfhelp regimen maybe its just how things are. Zoologist Konrad Lorenz calls the rushed existence into which industrialized, commercialized man has precipitated himself and all its attendant afflictionsulcers, hypertension, neuroses, etc.an inexpedient development, or evolutionary maladaptation, brought on by our ferocious intraspecies competition. He likens us to birds whose alluringly long plumage has rendered them flightless, easy prey. I cant help but wonder whether all this histrionic exhaustion isnt a way of covering up the fact that most of what we do doesnt matter. I once dated a woman that interned at a magazine where she wasnt allowed to take lunch hours out, lest she be urgently needed. This was an entertainment magazine whose raison detre had been obviated when Menu buttons appeared on remotes, so its hard to see this pretense of indispensability as anything other than a form of institutional selfdelusion. Based on the volume of my email correspondence and the amount of Internet ephemera I am forwarded on a daily basis, I suspect that most people with office jobs are doing as little as I am. More and more people in this country no longer make or do anything tangible if your job wasnt performed by a cat or a boa constrictor or a worm in a Tyrolean hat in a Richard Scarry book Im not convinced its necessary. Yes, I know were all very busy, but what, exactly, is getting done? Are all those people running late for meetings and yelling on their cell phones stopping the spread of malaria or developing feasible alternatives to fossil fuels or making anything beautiful? This busyness serves as a kind of existential reassurance, a hedge against emptiness Obviously your life cannot possibly be silly or trivial or meaningless if you are so busy, completely booked, in demand every hour of the day.

All this noise and rush and stress seem contrived to drown out or cover up some fear at the center of our lives. I know that after Ive spent a whole day working or running errands or answering emails or watching movies, keeping my brain busy and distracted, as soon as I lie down to sleep all the niggling quotidian worries and Big Picture questions Ive successfully kept at bay come crowding into my brain like monsters swarming out of the closet the instant you turn off the nightlight. When you try to meditate, your brain suddenly comes up with a list of a thousand urgent items you should be obsessing about rather than simply sit still. One of my correspondents suggests that what were all so afraid of is being left alone with ourselves. Ill say it I am not busy. I am the laziest ambitious person I know. Like most writers, I feel like a reprobate who does not deserve to live on any day that I do not write, but I also feel like 4 or 5 hours is enough to earn my stay on the planet for one more day. On the best ordinary days of my life, I write in the morning, go for a long bike ride and run errands in the afternoon, and see friends, read, or watch a movie in the evening. The very best days of my life are given over to uninterrupted debauchery, but these are, alas, undependable and increasingly difficult to arrange. This, it seems to me, is a sane and pleasant pace for a day. And if you call me up and ask whether I wont maybe blow off work and check out the new American Wing at the Met or ogle girls in Central Park or just drink chilled pink minty cocktails all day long, I will say, What time? But just recently, I insidiously started, because of professional obligations, to become busy. For the first time in my life I was able to tell people, with a straight face, that I was too busy to do this or that thing they wanted me to do. I could see why people enjoy this complaint It makes you feel important, soughtafter, and putupon. Its also an unassailable excuse for declining boring invitations, shirking unwelcome projects, and avoiding human interaction. Except that I hated actually being busy. Every morning my inbox was full of emails asking me to do things I did not want to do or presenting me with problems that I had to solve. It got more and more intolerable, until finally I fled town to the Undisclosed Location from which Im writing this. Here I am largely unmolested by obligations. There is no TV. To check email I have to drive to the library. I go a week at a time without seeing anyone I know. Ive remembered about buttercups, stinkbugs, and the stars. I read a lot. And Im finally getting some real writing done for the first time in months. Its hard to find anything to say about life without immersing yourself in the world, but its also just about impossible to figure out what that might be, or how best to say it, without getting the hell out of it again. I know not everyone has an isolated cabin to flee to. But not having cable or the Internet turns out to be cheaper than having them. And nature is still technically free, even if human beings have tried to make access to it expensive. Time and quiet should not be luxury items. Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence, or a vice It is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets. The space and quiet that idleness provides is a necessary condition for standing back from life and seeing it whole, for making unexpected connections and waiting for the wild summer lightning strikes of inspirationit is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.

This may sound like the pronouncement of some bongsmoking anarchist, but it was in fact Arthur C. Clarke, who found time between scuba diving and pinball games to write Childhoods End and think up communications satellites. Ted Rall recently wrote a column proposing that we divorce income from work, giving each citizen a guaranteed paycheck, which sounds like the kind of lunatic notion thatll be a basic human right in about a century, like abolition, universal suffrage, and 8hour workdays. I know how heretical it sounds in America, but theres really no reason we shouldnt regard drudgery as an evil to rid the world of if possible, like polio. It was the Puritans who perverted work into a virtue, evidently forgetting that God invented it as a punishment. Now that the old taskmaster is out of office, maybe we could all take a long smoke break. I suppose the world would soon slide to ruin if everyone behaved like me. But I would suggest that an ideal human life lies somewhere between my own defiant indolence and the rest of the worlds endless frenetic hustle. My own life has admittedly been absurdly cushy. But my privileged position outside the hive may have given me a unique perspective on it. Its like being the designated driver at a bar When youre not drinking, you can see drunkenness more clearly than those actually experiencing it. Unfortunately the only advice I have to offer the Busy is as unwelcome as the advice youd give the Drunk. Im not suggesting everyone quit their jobsjust maybe take the rest of the day off. Go play some skeeball. Fuck in the middle of the afternoon. Take your daughter to a matinee. My role in life is to be a bad influence, the kid standing outside the classroom window making faces at you at your desk, urging you to just this once to make some excuse and get out of there, come outside and play. Even though my own resolute idleness has mostly been a luxury rather than a virtue, I did make a conscious decision, a long time ago, to choose time over money, since you can always make more money. And Ive always understood that the best investment of my limited time on earth is to spend it with people I love. I suppose its possible Ill lie on my deathbed regretting that I didnt work harder, write more, and say everything I had to say, but I think what Ill really wish is that I could have one more round of Delanceys with Nick, another long latenight talk with Lauren, one last good hard laugh with Harold. Life is too short to be busy. Spirit animal Sponge Cal Fussman Cal Fussman TW calfussman, calfussman.com is a New York Times bestselling author and a writeratlarge for Esquire magazine, where he is best known for being a primary writer of the What Ive Learned feature. The Austin Chronicle has described Cals interviewing skills as peerless. He has transformed oral history into an art form, conducting probing interviews with icons who have shaped the last 50 years of world history Mikhail Gorbachev, Jimmy Carter, Ted Kennedy, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Jack Welch, Robert De Niro, Clint Eastwood, Al Pacino, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Bruce Springsteen, Dr. Dre, Quincy Jones, Woody Allen, Barbara Walters, Pel, Yao Ming, Serena Williams, John Wooden, Muhammad Ali, and countless others.

At the time, I had no money. They would put out these little hors doeuvres, and that was where my dinner would be, if the guys with expense accounts werent going out later. . . . Inside Sports wasnt a job, it was an experience. It was an event every evening. Whos coming tonight? Inside Sports was an artistic success but not a commercial one. It went belly up, and Cal was out of a job and largely out of money I didnt know what to do, so I called up my mom and dad. I said You know, I think Im going to take some time off and travel, and my mom, whos always really supportive, said Oh, Cal, thats wonderful. Little did she know when I said it that I wasnt coming back for 10 years. But I didnt know it, either. I just bought a ticket to go over to Europe, left with a few guys, and that started a 10year odyssey of Cal going around the world. The Magic of Goulash The trip down the aisle on a bus or train, during his travels was where all the stakes were. Because as Im going down that aisle, Ive got to look for an empty seat next to somebody who seems interesting. Somebody I can trust, somebody who might be able to trust me. The stakes are high because I know that at the end of that ride, wherever it was going, that person had to invite me to their home. Because I had no money to spend night after night in a hotel. The clincher question Cal used to get free room and board around Europe as a poor traveler was Can you tell me How do you make the perfect goulash? He would purposefully sit down next to grandmas, who would then pour out their souls. After a few minutes of passionate pantomiming, people would come from around the train to help translate, no matter the country. Cal never had to worry about where he was spending the night. During one dinner party a grandma threw in Hungary to feed me goulash, one of the neighbors says, Have you ever tasted apricot brandy? Because nobody makes apricot brandy like my father. He lives a half an hour away. Youve got to come to taste the apricot brandy. That weekend, were tasting apricot brandy, having a great time. Another party starts, another neighbor comes over to me. Have you ever been to Kiskunhalas, the paprika capital of the world? You cannot leave Hungary without visiting Kiskunhalas. Now were off to Kiskunhalas. Im telling you, a single question about goulash could get me 6 weeks of lodging and meals, and thats how I got passed around the world. 10 years. 10 years. Aim for the Heart, Not the Head Lesson number one, when people ask me what interviewing tips would I give, is aim for the heart, not the head. Once you get the heart, you can go to the head. Once you get the heart and the head, then youll have a pathway to the soul. Be Different, Not Just Better Cal was able to get 30 minutes with Mikhail Gorbachev in his prime, even after a publicist allotted him 2 and a half. How? Go to the heart with the first question. Heres the beginning of the story So the publicist leads me into the room, and at this point Im thinking, Okay, if its 2 and a half minutes, just do your best. I look up and there he is, Gorby. Hes a little older than I remember, about 77 at the time. He was in town to speak about nuclear weapons and why they should be abolished. We sit down. Im looking at him, and I just know hes expecting my first question to be about nuclear arms, world politics, perestroika, Ronald Reagan. Hes just ready. So I looked at him and I said Whats the best lesson your father ever taught you? He is surprised, pleasantly surprised. He looks up and he doesnt answer. Hes thinking about this. Its as if, after a little while, hes seeing this movie of his past on the ceiling, and he starts to tell me this story. Its a story about the day his dad was called to go fight in World War II. See, Gorbachev lived on a farm, and it was a long distance between this farm and the town where Gorbachevs dad had to join the other men to go off to war. . . . Dont panic. Let the silence do the work. This was Cals advice to me, when I mentioned that I sometimes panic and jump in if an interviewee freezesseemingly stumpedafter a question. Another quote that has helped me to be calm in such situations is from Krista Tippett, host of the public radio program and podcast On Being Listening is about being present, not just being quiet.

A Question Cal Suggests Asking People More Often What are some of the choices youve made that made you who you are? The Good Shit Sticks Cal once asked Harry Crews, novelist and author of A Feast of Snakes and Car, how he could remember anything, given how much booze and drugs he consumed. Harry kept no diary. His response was, Boy, the good shit sticks. This was what Cal recalled decades later, when he lost an entire box of research notes in his basementtheyd been soaked by a rainstorm and the pages turned black. Cals ultimate piece, written from memory and titled Drinking at 1,300 Feet, is incredible. It won a James Beard Award, which is akin to an Oscar in the food world. One of the starting lines in the piece is We all know the feeling of wanting to do something so well and so badly that we try too hard and cant do it at all. So, You Want to Write a Book? Cal described why he sometimes gifts Gabriel Garca Mrquezs One Hundred Years of Solitude to wouldbe writers If youve never written a book and youre going to tell somebody you want to write a great book, all right. Read this and know what a great book is. If You Were a Billionaire . . . I asked Cal, If you were a billionaire and could give 2 to 3 books to every graduating high school senior in the country this year, what would they be? His answer updated since the podcast is For everyone How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. For females West with the Night by Beryl Markham. For males The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe. Thats a good start for a journey. What would you put on a billboard? LISTEN.

The back of his business card sports three words, stark on ivory stock PLAY WITH FIRE. Remember the good shit sticks? Josh had to embrace Cal Fussmans philosophy page 495 when he moved his restaurant Saison in the early days. There was a sewage flood that overtook the entire restaurant the day of their move, and all of his handwritten recipe books were destroyed. Josh had to look on the bright side But, we were moving to a new space, so there was a positive spin. I thought, Fuck itwere just going to start over. Its the same thing that we started with before opening the first time. Its all up here in his head. He reinvented Saison with no original notebooks but also no baggage. It became the first restaurant in San Francisco history to earn three Michelin stars alongside Benu. Whats the best decision youve made with your new restaurant space? We were starting over, actually. I think the best decision I made was just to say, Lets really start over. Lets just completely empty our cup here and really think about what is valuable to me now. Whats honest. Whats sincere about what were doing? Lets do that. Thats still the driver of Saison now. Mostgifted or recommended books?

They got so scalding to the touch that we needed to wrap them in towels. Rick was introduced to regular sauna use by Chris Chelios, a friend and former professional hockey player. Chris had one of the longer careers of any NHL player, competing until he was 48. He played the most games of any active player in the NHL, and holds the record for most games played in the NHL by a defenseman. Chris largely credits his sports longevity, and general lack of illness, to daily sauna use. Rick wears a Tshirt, shorts, and flipflops everywhere. If a restaurant requires a different dress code, he doesnt go. Rick and Kelly Starrett page 122 were the first people to introduce me to the incredible ChiliPad page 139. Adele effectively scrapped the first version of her 25 album based on, among other things, Ricks feedback. She went back to the drawing board and began again. The new and improved 25 became the worlds bestselling album of 2015. The Cleansing Power of Cold Often, exercise will make me feel better, meditating will make me feel better, but the ice bath is the greatest of all. Its just magicsauna, ice, back and forth. By the end of the fourth, or fifth, or sixth round of being in an ice tub, there is nothing in the world that bothers you. 20 Minutes of Sun in the Morning Rick has lost more than 100 pounds since his peak weight. He has completely physically remodeled himself, can kick my ass in paddleboarding, and credits Dr. Phil Maffetone with many critical changes, including improving his circadian rhythm. Rick now typically wakes between 730 and 830 a.m., reversing a lifetime of nocturnal living. What did it? When I was in college at NYU, I never took a class before 3 p.m., because I knew I wouldnt go. . . . Before meeting Dr. Maffetone I slept with blackout blinds, and I usually didnt leave the house until the sun was setting. He said, From now on, when you wake up, I want you to go outside. As soon as you wake up, open the blinds, and go outside, naked if possible, and be in the sun for 20 minutes. TF I now do my morning meditation outside and shirtless whenever possible. I tried naked but nearly got kicked out of a Parisian hotel, as my private courtyard turned out to be shared. Bonjour! The Best Art Divides the Audience I first saw Ricks name in a cassette insert for the very first heavy metal album I bought Slayers Reign in Blood. I asked him about signing them When we signed Slayer, there was this terrible fear. . . . They were doing their first album for a major label, and the fear was that they were going to sell out. . . . I always liked extreme things, and they were extreme, and I wanted to maximize it. I didnt want to water it downthe idea of watering things down for a mainstream audience, I dont think it applies. I think people want things that are really passionate, and often, the best version they could be is not for everybody. . . . The best art divides the audience. If you put out a record, and half the people who hear it absolutely love it, and half the people who hear it absolutely hate it, youve done well, because its pushing that boundary. Advice to your younger self? To be kinder to myself, because I think Ive beaten myself up a lot. I expect a lot from myself, Ill be hard on myself, and I dont know that Im doing anyone any good by doing that. TIM Something that I struggle with ison one handI dont want to beat myself up, but on the other hand, I feel like the perfectionism that I have has enabled me to achieve whatever modicum of success Ive had. Ive heard stories about ZZ Top and La Futura, and how they worked on it with you from 2008 to 2012, and they realized the value of your wanting the art to be as perfect as it could be, or the best it could be, and taking whatever time and pains necessary to make that possible. I want to be easier on myself, but I worry that if I do that, I will lose whatever magic, if there is such a thing, that enables me to do what I do. RICK I think, ultimately, thats a myth. I think that your take on things is specific to you and not dependent on perfectionismits almost like youve won the war, and to accept the fact that youve won the war You have an audience. People are willing to hear what you are interested in, what youre interested in learning about, and what you want to share. You can do that without killing yourself. And killing yourself wont be of service, neither to you nor your audience. Need to Get Unstuck? Make Your Task Laughably Small How does Rick help artists who feel stuck? Usually, Ill give them homeworka small, doable task. Ill give you an example.

Usually, Ill give them homeworka small, doable task. Ill give you an example. There was an artist I was working with recently who hadnt made an album in a long time, and he was struggling with finishing anything. He just had this version of a writers block. But I would give him very doable homework assignments that almost seemed like a joke. Tonight, I want you to write one word in this song that needs five lines, that you cant finish. I just want one word that you like by tomorrow. Do you think that you could come up with one word? The Beginning Is heart work, not head work So much of the job is more emotion and heart work than it is head work. The head comes in after, to look at what the heart has presented and to organize it. But the initial inspiration comes from a different place, and its not the head, and its not an intellectual activity. Learn from the Greats, Not Your Competition Going to museums and looking at great art can help you write better songs. Reading great novels . . . seeing a great movie . . . reading poetry. . . . The only way to use the inspiration of other artists is if you submerge yourself in the greatest works of all time. . . . If you listen to the greatest songs ever made, that would be a better way to work through finding your own voice today, rather than listening to whats on the radio now and thinking, I want to compete with this. . . . For music, search online for MOJOs 100 Greatest Albums Ever Made, or Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, or any trusted sources top 100 albums, and start listening to what are considered the greats. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? Don Wildman. Hes 82 years old, and he did 23 pullups on the beach the other day. Hes in the Senior Olympics. He retired . . . because he wanted to spend his days enjoying life and exercising. Hes one of the most inspiring, uplifting, great, successful people on so many levels. TF Laird Hamilton, Gabby Reece, and Brian MacKenzie also bring Don up constantly see page 92. I highly recommend reading an Esquire profile of him from a few years ago titled The Worlds Healthiest 75YearOld Man. From that piece Wildman officially retired in 1994, at age 61 after selling his company to what became Bally Total Fitness, not because hed lost his passion for the business but because having a jobeven one in the fitness industrymade it difficult to snowboard 100 days a year. The Soundtrack of Excellence As mentioned before, more than 80 of the worldclass performers Ive interviewed meditate in the mornings in some fashion. But what of the remaining 20? Nearly all of them have meditationlike activities. One frequent pattern is listening to a single track or album on repeat, which can act as an external mantra for aiding focus and presentstate awareness. Here are just a few examples Alex Honnold, free solo climbing phenom The Last of the Mohicans soundtrack Rolf Potts, author of Vagabonding and others ambitones like The Zen Effect in the key of C for 30 minutes, made by Rolfe Kent, the composer of music for movies like Sideways, Wedding Crashers, and Legally Blonde Matt Mullenweg, lead developer of WordPress, CEO of Automattic Everyday by AAP Rocky and One Dance by Drake Amelia Boone, the worlds most successful female obstacle course racer Tonight Tonight by the Smashing Pumpkins and Keep Your Eyes Open by NEEDTOBREATHE Chris Young, mathematician and experimental chef Paul Oakenfolds Live at the Rojan in Shanghai, Pete Tongs Essential Mix Jason Silva, TV and YouTube philosopher Time from the Inception soundtrack by Hans Zimmer Chris Sacca Harlem Shake by Baauer and Lift Off by Jay Z and Kanye West, featuring Beyonc.

What book or books have you gifted most to other people? The Old Man and the Sea, Leaves of Grass first edition. If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere, what would it say? Breathe.

Taking the time to walk to work every day 5 miles, 1 hour 15 minutes There are only four stories a love story between two people, a love story between three people, the struggle for power, and the journey. Every single book that is in the bookstore deals with these four archetypes, these four themes. The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion. Paulo Coelho Paulo Coelho FBTW paulocoelho, paulocoelhoblog.com has long been one of my writing inspirations. His books, of near universal appeal, include The Alchemist and his most recent, The Spy, and have been translated into more than 70 languages. He is staggeringly consistent as a writer and averages one book every 2 years. As I type this, I am under the pressure of deadlines and often feel as Kurt Vonnegut did When I write, I feel like an armless, legless man with a crayon in his mouth. There is much to learn from Paulo. Back Story Few people realize that The Alchemist, which has sold more than 65 million copies worldwide, was originally published by a small Brazilian publisher to the tune of 900 copies. They declined to reprint it! It wasnt until after his subsequent novel Brida that The Alchemist was revived and took off. Paulo was born in Brazil but now lives in Geneva, Switzerland, where he recorded the audio for my podcast. What Does Your Morning and Daily Routine Look Like? I sit down, of course. I have the book inside of me, and I start procrastinating. In the morning, I check my emails, I check news, I check everything that I could check just to postpone, for the moment, sitting and facing myself. For 3 hours, Im trying to tell myself, No, no, no. Later, later, later, and then, one moment, I sayjust not to lose face in front of myselfIm going to sit, and Im going to write for half an hour. And I do. Of course, this half an hour becomes 10 hours in a row. Thats why I write my books very quickly, because I cannot stop. . . . But I cannot stop procrastinating. Probably, this is my inner ritual. I have to feel guilty about not writing for 3 hours or 4 hours. Then, when Im there, I start writing and its nonstop. . . .

A successful writing day is a day that I suffer in the morning, and I have fun in the evening, fun by writing. I should not describe this as fun. Its also painful . . . Im in a kind of trance. When I go to bed after 10 hours of working, well, the adrenaline is still circulating in my blood. It takes hours to sleep. There is this notepad by my side, and I take notes, but I take notes only to take them out from my head. They will be useless the next day. I never use notes that I take . . . and this has happened since I wrote my first book, The Pilgrimage. I cannot change this process. I wish I could sit and write and not feel guilty for 4 or 5 hours during the day. It is impossible. TF Even the best in the world struggle. I need to relearn this lesson often. For most writers who didnt start off as journalists e.g., Malcolm Gladwell, Neil Strauss, writing is hard and continues to be hard. What makes it easier? Knowing that many of the greats are going through the same thing. Its reassuring to know that someone at the top of their gamewho has seemingly beaten all of the oddsstill has the daily struggle. What are the most common mistakes or weaknesses of firsttime novelists? Keep it simple. Trust your reader. He or she has a lot of imagination. Dont try to describe things. Give a hint, and they will fulfill this hint with their own imagination. Thats why I am so reluctant to sell the rights of my books for movies because there, you have everything. The viewer does not need to think. However, if I say like in Aleph, at the very beginning, I am in my house in the Pyrenees, and there is an oak there. I dont need to explain my house in the Pyrenees. I only needed to put in the elements that are important the oak, myself, and the person that Im talking to. Thats all. . . . Trust your reader. Understand that he or she can fill the empty spaces. Dont overexplain. How do you capture ideas that might help your writing? I strongly encourage writers not to think about writing every time they do something. Forget notebooks. Forget taking notes. Let what is important remain. Whats not important goes away. When you sit down to write, there is this process of purging, this process of cleansing, where only the important things remain. Its much easier than taking notes and overloading yourself with information. What do you find helpful when you are stuck or stagnated? There is only one thing. When I feel stagnated, I promise myself that even if I dont feel inspired, I need to move forward. I need to have discipline. . . . In the middle of a book, there I am I dont know how to continue the story, even if its a nonfiction story. But then, I say, You, book, are fighting with me. Okay. Im going to sit here, and Im not going to leave you alone until I find my way out of this crossroads. It may take 10 minutes. It may take 10 hours. But if you dont have enough discipline, you dont move forward. . . . TF Several people in this book, including yours truly, have found Anne Lamotts book Bird by Bird a lifeline during bookrelated crises of faith. One friend was on the verge of returning his advance to the publisher and calling it quits. Instead, I loaned him my copy of Bird by Bird. He regained his confidence, and his book became a New York Times bestseller. Do you have a team, or researchers, who help you? I dont have researchers, no. No, no . . . If you overload your book with a lot of research, youre going to be very boring to yourself and to your readers. Books are not here to show how intelligent and cultivated you are. Books are out there to show your heart, to show your soul, and to tell your fans, readers You are not alone.

The benefits of even 30 minutes a week of scribbling can transfer to everything else that you do. The following bullets are writing prompts that Cheryl has suggested when asked for assignment ideas for students whove read Wild. They are brilliant and make fantastic jumpingoff points for any type of journaling or writing, whether Morning Pages page 224, a blog post, the beginning of a novel, a letter to a friend, a diary entry, a screenplay, or a toofasttoosoon Tinder message. Try one for two pages of longhand writing. Go for uninterrupted flow, and dont stop to edit. Step one is to generate without judging. Chances are that youll surprise yourself. Write about a time when you realized you were mistaken. Write about a lesson you learned the hard way. Write about a time you were inappropriately dressed for the occasion. Write about something you lost that youll never get back. Write about a time when you knew youd done the right thing. Write about something you dont remember. Write about your darkest teacher. Write about a memory of a physical injury. Write about when you knew it was over. Write about being loved. Write about what you were really thinking. Write about how you found your way back. Write about the kindness of strangers. Write about why you could not do it. Write about why you did. Spirit animal Jaguar Ed Cooke Ed Cooke TW tedcooke, memrise.com is the CEO of Memrise and a certified Grandmaster of Memory. This means hes able to memorize and recite A a 1,000digit number within an hour, B a shuffled pack of cards within a few of minutes, and C 10 packs of shuffled cards within an hour. Perhaps more impressive, he can quickly train others to do the same. In 2010, he was interviewed by a journalist named Joshua Foer. Under Eds Yodalike tutelage, in 2011, Joshua became the very next American Memory Champion. It took less than a year for Ed to transform a novice into worldclass. The result was Foers book Moonwalking with Einstein. On the Magic of Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe Goethe is really cool. . . . At the age of 25, he writes a novel, which is extraordinarily brilliant The Sorrows of Young Werther, about the troubles of young Goethe. Its this wonderful story of a young man who falls in love, and it doesnt really work out so well. . . . Goethe wrote this book by locking himself in a hotel room for 3 months, imagining his five best friends on different chairs, and then discussing with his imaginary friends different possibilities of plot and so on and so forth. This is an example, by the way, of that spatial separation I was talking about. TF Humans naturally remember faces, people, and locationsspaces well, so you can use them to construct mnemonic devices like the memory palace technique, for example. In ones own mind, were somehow inherently boxed in and constricted, and by imagining in different spatial locations and then iterating an ideaor novel, in this casethrough perspectives, he was able to give himself five perspectives separated out, and give himself a multidimensional playground for creating a work of art . . . which, by the way, is an awesome technique. TF We dont need inperson mentors as often as we think. Every day, using people from this book, I will ask myself questions like What would Matt Mullenweg do? or What would Jocko say? Feeling like a Loser As We All Do Sometimes When I was at school, I would lose a debating competition or discover that I was a loser in a more general sense. I had what I call, in a way, a mind hack. Id be sitting on the loo or something and Id just think, Oh, everything feels terrible and awful. Its all gone to shit. Then Id consider, But if you think about it, the stars are really far away, then you try to imagine the world from the stars. Then you sort of zoom in and youre like, Oh, theres this tiny little character there for a fragment of time worrying about X. TF This is similar to the star therapy that BJ Miller describes on page 401. I use a combination of both each night before bed. Book recommendations In Praise of Idleness and Other Essays by Bertrand Russell The Joyous Cosmology by Alan Watts Maxims and Reflections by Goethe I was traveling around the world at the age of 18, which is what people in England do between high school and university.

Then Id consider, But if you think about it, the stars are really far away, then you try to imagine the world from the stars. Then you sort of zoom in and youre like, Oh, theres this tiny little character there for a fragment of time worrying about X. TF This is similar to the star therapy that BJ Miller describes on page 401. I use a combination of both each night before bed. Book recommendations In Praise of Idleness and Other Essays by Bertrand Russell The Joyous Cosmology by Alan Watts Maxims and Reflections by Goethe I was traveling around the world at the age of 18, which is what people in England do between high school and university. In my coat, I had Goethes aphorisms, his short little thoughts in my pocket. I read and reread this book. . . . Its actually had quite a fundamental impact on my life because these are his little snippets of wisdom on almost any imaginable topic, and all of them are brilliant. There are things like, The company of women is schooling in good manners, or Boldness has genius, power, and magic. Ones you dont remember in their precise form, but which nonetheless act as little micro filters for interpreting reality. Touching the Rock by John Hull. This is about a mans slow descent into blindness over 20 years. Hes a kind of theologian, but he has these wonderful reflections on how he came to enjoy the world as a blind man. One goto example is that rain is the best thing for blind people, because you can hear the world in three dimensions. The pattering of the raindrops on the roofs, the pavement, the lampposts, and the buildings, gives youbecause of the echoa sense of 3D space, where most of the time your 3D space only goes a couple of yards in front of you, and otherwise is just the void. Looking somebody in the eye . . . is often the antidote for what is ailing us. Spirit animal Sloth Amanda Palmer Amanda Palmer TW amandapalmer, amandapalmer.net first rose to prominence as one half of the internationally acclaimed punk cabaret duo The Dresden Dolls. Her surprise hit TED presentation, The Art of Asking, has been viewed more than 8 million times. She followed up with a book expanding on the lessons, titled The Art of Asking How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Let People Help. I read it and upgraded my life in an afternoon of asking for help. Just Take on the Pain, and Wear It as a Shirt Amanda explains how she got the nickname and stage name Amanda Fucking Palmer It was one of those things where Ben Folds, producer of her first solo album had someone who was a friend of a current enemy, who referred to meevery time she referred to meas Amanda Fucking Palmer. And so Ben, because we were working on a record in Nashville together for a month, as a joke, started calling me AFP. . . . You lose your mind in the studio, and everything devolves into toilet humor instantly. That just became the running studio joke, and that was Bens pet name for me, and I thought it was funny enough that I started using it myself. Then it just sort of turned into a thing. I dont even know how it turned into a thing, but I think thats a good nickname. . . . It lands on you, and then it sticks like glue. TIM I love it. So you disarmed the insult by adopting it completely. AMANDA Which kind of is my life philosophy. TIM I love that. AMANDA No, really. Just take on the pain, and wear it as a shirt. TF This is precisely why I regularly refer to myself a professional dilettante when Im being interviewed by someone who views me as a dabbling generalist which I probably am. By preemptively using the language of a critic, I remove some of their potential weapons. Two Words for Conflict Resolution My mentors life advice to me, when Im going into a conflict or a difficult situation with my parents or an argument with Neil Gaiman, her husband is, Say less. Thats it. Just say less. EXPLAINING HER EARLY SUCCESS AS A STREET PERFORMER I treated every single patron like a tensecond love affair. Amandas Meditation Practice Basic vipassana meditation, nothing fancy, no crazy mantras, no gods or deities, just basically sitting on the earth as a human being and paying attention to your breath and your body and letting thoughts come and go, but really trying not to be attached to the drama that comes visiting. Dropping Ashes on the Buddha One of my absolute favorite books of all time, because it changed my life, is a book called Dropping Ashes on the Buddha. Its by Zen Master Seung Sahn, who was a Korean Zen monk. I read it when I was maybe 24, and its a short book just a series of letters that this really funny, very direct, very nobullshit Korean monk wrote back and forth with his students in the 1970s.

Aim Narrow, Own Your Own Category The following is one of my favorite excerpts from The Art of Asking, which I highlighted because it beautifully showcases the 1,000 True Fans philosophy Im so fond of page 292 Dita Von Teese, a star in the contemporary burlesque scene, once recounted something shed learned in her early days stripping in L.A. Her colleaguesbleachblonde dancers with fake tans, Brazilian wax jobs, and neon bikiniswould strip bare naked for an audience of 50 guys in the club and be tipped a dollar by each guy. Dita would take the stage wearing satin gloves, a corset, and a tutu, and do a sultry striptease down to her underwear, confounding the crowd. And then, though 49 guys would ignore her, one would tip her fifty dollars. That man, Dita said, was her audience. Any quotes you live by, or think of often? Honor those who seek the truth, beware of those whove found it adapted from Voltaire. A reminder that the path never ends and that absolutely nobody has this shit figured out. Spirit animal Mirror orchid Eric Weinstein Eric Weinstein TW ericrweinstein is managing director of Thiel Capital, a PhD in mathematical physics from Harvard, and a research fellow at the Mathematical Institute of Oxford University. BEHIND THE SCENES This is the text from Eric that catalyzed our podcast Do you want to try a podcast on the topics in our text thread . . . psychedelics, theories of everything, and the need to destroy education in order to save it? The most viral thing Eric has ever written is about Kung Fu Panda, his alltime favorite film In Kung Fu Panda, how does Po end up developing the capability to be an awesome Kung Fu fighter? on Quora. Eric has also written about professional wrestling as a metaphor for living in a constructed and false reality see Kayfabe on Edge.org. 2,0003,000 PEOPLE, NOT GENERAL FAME This is one of the messages Eric burned into my brain last year, and its guided many decisions since. We were sitting in a large soaking tub talking about the world as mathematicians and human guinea pigs do in San Francisco, and he said General fame is overrated. You want to be famous to 2,000 to 3,000 people you handpick. Im paraphrasing, but the gist is that you dont need or want mainstream fame. It brings more liabilities than benefits. However, if youre known and respected by 23K highcaliber people e.g., the live TED audience, you can do anything and everything you want in life. It provides maximal upside and minimal downside. GOOD QUESTION TO ASK YOURSELF WHEN TACKLING INCUMBENT COMPANIES OR IDEAS How is their bread buttered? What is it that they cant afford to say or think? CONSENSUS SHOULD SET OFF YOUR SPIDEY SENSE Somehow, people have to learn that consensus is a huge problem. Theres no arithmetic consensus because it doesnt require a consensus. But there is a Washington consensus. There is a climate consensus. In general, consensus is how we bully people into pretending that theres nothing to see. Move along, everyone. I think that, in part, you should learn that people dont naturally come to high levels of agreement unless something is either absolutely clear, in which case consensus isnt present, or theres an implied threat of violence to livelihood or self. TF I start nearly every public presentation I give with a slide that contains one quote Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, its time to pause and reflect. Mark Twain. This isnt just for my audience. Its also a reminder for me. CHANGE YOUR WORDS, CHANGE YOUR WORLD Eric has an amazing vocabulary that regularly stumps me, and we speak a lot about the cultureshaping power of language. As mentioned in Reid Hoffmans profile page 228, one of my favorite quotes is from Ludwig Wittgenstein The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.

Google and Wikipedia will, at the least, continue to have has been accused of . . . , which is damning ambiguity. So, what to do? I think we can fight fire with fire. This is where bigoteer comes in. Bigoteer na person who implies other people are bigots, for personal gain. Lets say a writer takes the lazy route for cheap applause i.e., sensationalizing for clicks and haphazardly accuses others of being an ist like sexist or racist. That mudslinger could now become labeled as a wellknown bigoteer in their own Wikipedia entry, for instance. This would create a consequence and disincentive, which I dont see currently, to acting in such a cavalier and damaging way. Outofcontrol political correctness and online lynch mobs are the end of free speech. Fight it. The world we live in is becoming a horrible consensus reality. Dont run over the cliff. DEFINING A HIGHAGENCY PERSON Eric said highagency person in passing, and I asked him to elaborate When youre told that something is impossible, is that the end of the conversation, or does that start a second dialogue in your mind, how to get around whoever it is thats just told you that you cant do something? So, how am I going to get past this bouncer who told me that I cant come into this nightclub? How am I going to start a business when my credit is terrible and I have no experience? TF Eric describes The Martian as The ultimate highagency film. WHAT IS CANONICAL DESIGN? Well, lets look at nature. Theres a great virus called T4 bacteriophage. If you look it up, its like a lunar lander. Its really cool. The genetic material is held in a capsule called a capsid that has the form of an icosahedron 20faced polyhedron. . . . Its a little crazy to think that before Plato ever existed, nature had figured out this complicated 20sided object. But because it was so natural at a mathematical level, even if it was complex, nature found the canonical design even though there was no canonical designer. . . . Because it was a Godgiven form, it didnt need to be thunk up, if you will, by any individual. Or the recent discovery of grasshoppers that use gear mechanisms for jumping. You would think we had invented gears. But, in fact, gears are such a natural idea that natural selection found it long before we did. . . . These forms really dont have an inventor so much as a discoverer. Mostgifted or recommended books? For my science friends, I tell them to read The Emperor of Scent, by Chandler Burr, about my friend Luca Turin. It talks about a renegade scientist being stymied by the journal Nature, by various conferences, by the established research centers, and its just a wonderful introduction to how the dissident voice is marginalized. Because Luca is such a genius of olfaction and chemistry, hes able to take a perspective, which may or may not be true, but keep pushing forward and battling. So, thats one of my favorites. I have another weird recommendation, which is this book Heraclitean Fire by Erwin Chargaff, who effectively shorted Watson and Crick. He told Watson and Crick that he didnt think that they were very good or very smart, and that they didnt know their chemistry. They werent qualified to work on DNA, etc. It turned out that they got it right, and he got it wrong. When I heard that there was somebody who bet against Watson and Crick, I thought, Well, this is just going to be the laugh of the century, but it turned out that just to short those guys required another genius. He writes about trying to suppress these guys and failing because they were right and he was wrong. He has enough presence of mind to struggle with it. These are books that I think are incredibly powerful because they talk about what its like to be one against the many. THE POWER OF THINKING SIDEWAYS Nobody really knew how to do wheeled luggage before 1989. Its hard to imagine that the whole world had their heads wedged so far up there that they couldnt think to put in these recessed wheels with a telescoping handle. And this was the invention of a guy named Robert Plath, who was a pilot for Northwest, I think. In one fell swoop, he convinced everyone that their old luggage was terrible. So even though there wasnt a lot of growth, he created the growth because nobody wanted their old luggage. You could compare these discrete brainwave innovations across fields.

He writes about trying to suppress these guys and failing because they were right and he was wrong. He has enough presence of mind to struggle with it. These are books that I think are incredibly powerful because they talk about what its like to be one against the many. THE POWER OF THINKING SIDEWAYS Nobody really knew how to do wheeled luggage before 1989. Its hard to imagine that the whole world had their heads wedged so far up there that they couldnt think to put in these recessed wheels with a telescoping handle. And this was the invention of a guy named Robert Plath, who was a pilot for Northwest, I think. In one fell swoop, he convinced everyone that their old luggage was terrible. So even though there wasnt a lot of growth, he created the growth because nobody wanted their old luggage. You could compare these discrete brainwave innovations across fields. For example, in table tennis in the early 50s, the worst player on the Japanese team at the Bombay Table Tennis Championships was this guy Hiroji Satoh. He glued two foam expanses to both sides of a sandpaper table tennis bat, and nobody could cue off of the sounds because it changed the sound of the ball. TIM Like a silencer on a gun. ERIC Exactly. So if you put a suppressor on your paddle . . . TIM Suppressor. Just the fact that you used that word makes me think that you have a bunch of firearms hiding in your basement. ERIC I can neither confirm nor deny. But the idea that the worst player on one of the lowerrated teams would be the undisputed champion simply through an innovation that was that profound shows you what the power of one of these ideas is. TF These ideas having a secret as described in Peter Thiels Zero to One knowing or believing something that the rest of the world thinks is nonsense. The power laws are just so unbelievably in your favor if you win that it makes venturing outside the norm worthwhile. TIM Or Dick Fosbury, who went backwards over the high jump bar for the first time in the Olympics, winning gold ERIC 1968, you got it. TIM Ridiculed, then mimicked, and eventually made standard. ERIC In the case of the poorly designed standard umbrella I would, for example, immediately think about, lets say, the Japanese and their love of origami, and the mathematics of paper folding. That would be a place that I might see whether I could mine that silo of expertise for any application to the umbrella. Very often, its a question of being the first person to connect things that have never been connected before, and something that is a commonplace solution in one area is not thought of in another. FOR DEEP FUCKING CREATIVE WORK TIM If you are trying to do deep creative work that requires a lot of synthesis, or as Naval Ravikant might say, orthogonal thinking, what would your work cycle look like? ERIC I use a weird technique. I use coprolaliait sounds pornographic. TIM A little bit. ERIC You know the strings of obscenities that Tourettes patients involuntarily utter? Thats coprolalia. So, I find that when we use words that are prohibited to us, it tells our brain that we are inhabiting unsafe space. Its a bit of a sign that youre going into a different mode. . . . When Im going to do deep work, very often, it has a very powerful, aggressive energy to it. Its not easy to be around. Its very exacting, and I think I would probably look very autistic to people who know me to be social, were they ever to see me in work mode. TIM How do you incite that? Do you just start trying to string together as many obscenities as possible? Like an incantation? ERIC I have my same sequence. Its like an invariant mantra that I have to say. TIM Can you share it, or is that top secret? ERIC No, no. You cant share your meditation word. TIM Well, just some hints, then. How long is it? ERIC It probably takes me seven seconds to say it. You also have to decamp from normal reality where you start thinking about things like, Well, how am I negatively going to impact my neighbor? No, this is your time. Youre stealing the time. And the act of creation is itself a violent action. TF This odd technique does seem to quickly produce a slightly altered state. Try itwrite down a precise sequence of curse words that takes 7 to 10 seconds to read. Then, before a creative work session of some type, read it quickly and loudly like youre casting a spell or about to go postal. Eric also finds late nights, around 3 a.m., to be ideal for deep creative work. ERIC When the phone stops ringing, when you have no FOMO fear of missing out because everybodys asleep. Its a Monday night, and its just you and an expanse of whiteboard. Thats when the magic happens. OLD HABITS DIE HARDTHE WATCH SMILE In almost every advertisement for wristwatches, the watches are set to 1010. Until you see that, you cant really believe that its true. But afterwards, you realize that the world has just pulled one over on you, because 1010 looks like a smile to watch advertisers. TIM Oh, I guess its very symmetrical, isnt it? ERIC Yeah. But whats funny is that the wisdom has crept in to the point that sometimes youll see digital watch ads, and theyll still be set to 1010, even though it doesnt look like a smile.

ON STARTING to USE PSYCHEDELICS AFTER AGE 40 For his entire life, Eric believed that using psychedelics was like pouring acid on your brain and leaving it as Swiss cheese. That has changed in the last several years It wasnt until I started meeting some of the most intellectually gifted people in the sciences and beyond . . . I realized that this was sort of the open secret of what I call the hallucinogenic elite, whether its billionaires, or Nobel laureates, or inventors and coders. . . . A lot of these people were using these agents either for creativity or to gain access to the things that are so difficult to get access to through therapy and other conventional means. LEARNING DISABILITY OR TEACHING DISABILITY? . . . This is where we run into the trouble, which is we dont talk about teaching disabilities. We only talk about learning disabilities, and a lot of the kids that I want are kids who have been labeled learning disabled, but theyre actually super learners. Theyre like learners on steroids who have some deficits to pay for their superpower, and teachers cant deal with this. We label those kids learning disabled to cover up from the fact that the economics of teaching require that one central actor, the teacher, be able to lead a room of 20 or more people in lockstep. Well, thats not a good model. I want to get as many of my dangerous in a good way kids out of that idiom, whether it requires dropping out of high school, dropping out of college. But not for no purpose. Drop into something. Start creating, building. Join a lab. Skip college. ERICS MORNING ROUTINE Each morning is basically a struggle against a new day, which I view as a series of opponents who must be defeated. Im not a morning person. So every morning I get out of bed, Im just astounded that Ive done it. . . . It was Julian Schwinger, the great Harvard physicist, I think, who was asked if he would teach the 900 a.m. quantum mechanics course, and he stopped for a second. The person asking said, Well, whats the problem, Professor Schwinger? and he answered, I dont know if I can stay up that late. Advice to your 30year old self? When I was 30, I guess I was still struggling to stay in or get out of academics. What I didnt realize is that the structure of the universities was either hitting steady state, or growing very little, or shrinking. That was not a healthy place to be, because most of the good seats in the musical chairs competition e.g., tenured positions had already been found in the 60s, and they had occupants. . . . I think what I needed to do was decamp and realize that technology was going to be a boom area. And even though I wanted to do science rather than technology, its better to be in an expanding world and not quite in exactly the right field, than to be in a contracting world where peoples worst behavior comes out. In the latter, your mind is grooved in defensive and rentseeking types of ways. Life is too short to be petty and defensive and cruel to other people who are seeking to innovate alongside you. PARTING ADVICE? What I would really like is for those of you who have been told that youre learning disabled, or youre not good at math, or that youre terrible at music, or something like that, to seek out unconventional ways of proving that wrong. Believe not only in yourselves, but that there are ways, tools, methods powerful enough to make things that look very difficult much easier than you ever imagined.

Evan explains, At the time, all we knew was that we really wanted to get laid, we werent getting laid, and we werent supercool. It pays to write what you know. Seth started doing standup when he was 13 years old. He adds Thats something that came from standup comedy. Theres a comic named Darryl Lenox who still performs, who is great. I remember he saw me perform. . . . I would try to mimic other comedians like Steven Wright or Seinfeld, like, Whats the deal with Krazy Glue? and he said Dude, youre the only person here who could talk about trying to get a hand job for the first time. . . .

Get other peoples opinions. Share it with them. And most importantly, emotion is what matters. Its an emotional journey. . . . SETH . . . I remember one time we were filming a scene in Knocked Up and improvising, or maybe it was even 40YearOld Virgin, and the direction he screamed at usbecause he screams direction from another room a lot, which is hilariouswas, Less semen, more emotion! I think that is actually a good note to apply across the board. TIM You also mentioned that every character has to have a wound of some kind. EVAN Thats a big Juddism. TF Judd recommended they read The Art of Dramatic Writing by Lajos Egri Evan If youre a writer, 60 of it is useless and 40 of it is gold., which Judd said was Woody Allens favorite writing book. Weed for Creative Work Evan and Seth are both serious marijuana connoisseurs, and they use different strains for different purposes. For writing and other creative sessions, Evan considers Jack Herer to be a good working weed. Its described by Leafly online as a sativadominant cannabis strain that provides the perfect pairing of cerebral elevation and fullbody relief. Any parting thoughts or advice? EVAN In the end, Superbad was a success, but make no mistake, for 10 years it was a failure. And the first five drafts, if you read them, youd think, This is the worst thing Ive ever read in my life. SETH People told us over and over again, I dont think anyones going to make this movie, and it didnt even occur to us to listen to them. It wasnt even a conversation of Should we stop? We literally didnt even have that conversation. It was just like, Fuck those people. Lets go to the next one. EVAN To picture Stephen King writing his first book and then being like Man, Im stumped. Im gonna go be something else. You just keep going. SETH Blind belief in yourself. 8 Tactics for Dealing with Haters Life is a fullcontact sport, especially on the Internet.

Hell probably use your money to set a Guinness Book record for the most kittens strangled in one minute. Ah, welcome to town, kid. Want a tissue? That was 2007.

Not because Im bad, not because theyre bad, but because thats how the math works. If you anticipate it, it will throw you off less. On top of that, I assume that 1 of my fans are completely batshit crazy, just like the general population, which helps me handle the far scarier stuff. If you wrongly assume that everyone is going to respond with smiles and highfives, you are going to get slapped, youll respond impulsively, and youll triple the damage. And you are not exempt from Crazy Town just because you cover nonoffensive material. Here is a real, verbatim comment left on my blog You are showing a grave example of the white horseman to our children. Shame on you. Youre an evil one who has gained the world and lost your soul. He proceeded to threaten to deliver me on Judgment Day. It became a real FBIworthy threat! This was not in response to my post about clubbing baby seals. I dont have one. It was in response to a blog post I wrote to help raise funds for highneed public school classrooms in the U.S. through donorschoose.org that lack sufficient funding for books, pens, pencils, etc. Anticipate, dont react. 3When in doubt, starve it of oxygen. Here are my three primary responses to online criticism Starve it of oxygen ignore it90 Pour gasoline on it promote it8 Engage with trolls after too much wine and really regret it2 Im not going to cover option number three, but the first two are worth explaining. The reason that you would want to starve 90 of oxygen is because doing otherwise gives your haters extra Google juice. In other words, if you reply publiclyworstcase scenario, you put something on another site with high page rank and link to the criticall youre going to do is gift them powerful inbound links, increase traffic, and ensure the persistence and prominence of the piece. In some cases, Ive had to bite my tongue for months at a time to wait for something infuriating BS that I could easily refute to drop off the front page or even the second page of Google results. Its very, very hard to stay silent, and its very, very important to have that selfcontrol. Rewatch the Hoooold! Hooooooold! scene from Braveheart. But what about pouring gasoline on 8 of the negative? Why would anyone ever do that? First off, we must realize that not all critics are haters. Lets look at a realworld example. Eric Karjaluoto wrote a post called Is Tim Ferriss Acting Like an Asshole? in response to a spec design competition I held, which had caused a firestorm. I dont agree with all of his arguments, but he did have some wellthoughtthrough points that I felt contributed to a more interesting discussion. So I promoted his piece. For me, doing this 8 to 10 of the time accomplishes two things It shows that Im open to criticism, and it shows that I dont take myself too seriously. Both of these things tend to decrease the number of real haters who come out of the woodwork. 4If you respond, dont overapologize. There are times to apologize when you truly screw up or speak too soon, but more often than not, acknowledgment is all thats required. Some version of I see you will diffuse at least 80 of people who appear to be haters or wouldbe haters. Theyll even sometimes do an aboutface and become your strongest proponents. Just present the facts or wish them luck, and let them come to their own conclusions. I often use something along the lines of, Thanks for the feedback. Im always trying to improve. In the meantime, I hope you find what youre looking for. 5You cant reason someone out of something they didnt reason themselves into. 6Trying to get everyone to like you is a sign of mediocrity.

She learned a lot from the legendary Paula Poundstone Really try to find out what theyre trying to say. . . . Its really going deeper, and finding out why this person has chosen to disrupt a performance that everybody has paid for, and that everybody is there for and agreed to sit for? Why did somebody want to rebel against that? Im curious about it. I usually give them quite a lot of time. Theres the potential to create a whole show around them. . . . Then, I can ask them about who theyre with. I can ask the person theyre with things like, Why are they like that? Are they like this all the time? Is this a special thing? You can also talk to other people around them, people who are seated next to them What was this person like before the show? or What were they saying? What led us to this? TF This is pure genius. Sometimes, the best way to defuse or defeat attackers is to ask short questions and keep them talking. Even a simple, Why do you say that? Why do you ask? or Why would you say something like that? can do the trick. Online, Ill sometimes let famous people answer my hecklers in the form of quotes.

The world of herbs and spices is great, but before that, there are some other building blocks that I would prefer to have in my kitchen or my desert island hot chilies, shallots, and lemon. . . . Sure, I can pick cumin or cilantro or things like that, but they have fairly limited use. With the lemon, chilies, and an allium or shallot, I can do anything. I can do ceaseless variations on them. . . . Salt can act as an acid and citrus is an acid TF Hence, some chefs say, I use citrus like others use salt, and there is an incredible amount of acid in all the alliums. There is an incredible amount of acid in all of the chilies. Its no secret why those things are foodchanging, foodaltering, techniqueinspiring ingredients to use. Much more versatile in the kitchen than basil or thyme or something like that. Finding the Right Recipe for the Kitchen or Life Look for Details and Doers If you go on the Internet, there are 20 recipes for pound cake. I go with the one that even describes to a quarter of an inch the size of the pan. Because if someone is describing that level of detail, you know they have gone through it. The person who writes a recipe that says, Grease the cake pan without specifying the size? You know they havent made it. Its a tipoff right away that something is wrong. What is the best or most worthwhile investment youve made? The best thing I ever did, besides getting sober 25 years ago, was shelving my restaurant career in 2002, selling my shares in my restaurant, and working for free for a local radio station, magazine, and TV station in an effort to create my own media syllabus. I wanted to create a product with a massive platform, and try to make a difference in the world, and I couldnt do it without becoming a 40yearold intern, learning everything I needed, and rebooting my career.

What advice would you give your 30yearold self? At 30, I was a starving New York theater actor, just going around trying to get acting work, and barely making 17 grand a year doing theater. I did a bunch of side jobs. I was a man with a vanI had a moving company. I think what I would talk to myself about is, You have to believe in your capacity. You have to believe that your capacity is greater than you could probably imagine. To me, this is a kind of divine question. God has given us talents and faculties, and its up to us to discover them, expand them to their maximum, and use them for maximum service in the world. I had a lot more capacity at 30 than I thought. I thought of myself as, Well, I could get some acting work and maybe I could do an occasional guest spot on Law and Order and make enough money to just get by as an actor, so I dont have to drive this damn moving van. That was the extent of where my imagination was for myself. So I would just say, Believe in yourself more deeply. Youre bigger than that.

Getting to Normal This was extremely refreshing to hear from Rainn, as I often feel the same Im in my head a lot, and it kind of sucks. . . . So there are certain tools that I have to use to get by. Ive learned in my life that there are certain things I have to do to just be out of my head and get to normal. Im not talking about being really supereffective. Just to get to normal, I have to do meditation, I have to do some exercise. If I can get into nature, great. If I can play some tennis, better, and acting is that same way. Acting, rehearsing, playing characters, these are the things that get me out of my head and out of analyzing every goddamn thing that comes down the pike and leaves me miserable and making really bad choices. On Being the Best Version of Yourself As Oscar Wilde is thought to have said, Be yourself. Everyone else is taken I was cast in a Broadway show when I was about 29 or 30 years old. It was my first Broadway show, and I sucked. I bombed. Again, I was very in my head. I was very stuck, cerebral, and stiff. I couldnt get out of it, and I tried and I tried, but I was just terrible at the part. But after I finished that show, I thought You know what, fuck it. Im never doing that again. . . . I cant. Life is too short. Im too miserable, and Ive got to be me as an actor. I have to bring who I really am as a human to my acting. So Im offbeat and Im odd. Im a weirdo. I buy shirts at the thrift store, and this is who I am, and this is who I have to be. It really changed me as an actor and as an artist. . . . I never would have had the success that I had in L.A. and on TV and film in doing odd characters if I hadnt gone through that terrible, terrible ordeal. Any final thoughts? I dont want to sound like a pretentious asshole, but I would ask people to dig deeper. We can make the world a better place. We can ask more of ourselves. We can do more for others. I think that our life is a journey. . . . Dig deep on your journey and the world will benefit from it. The most important trick to be happy is to realize that happiness is a choice that you make and a skill that you develop. You choose to be happy, and then you work at it. Its just like building muscles. Spirit animal Owl Naval Ravikant Naval Ravikant TW naval, startupboy.com is the CEO and cofounder of AngelList.

If you want to be successful, surround yourself with people who are more successful than you are, but if you want to be happy, surround yourself with people who are less successful than you are. Handling Conflict The first rule of handling conflict is dont hang around people who are constantly engaging in conflict. . . . All of the value in life, including in relationships, comes from compound interest. People who regularly fight with others will eventually fight with you. Im not interested in anything thats unsustainable or even hard to sustain, including difficult relationships. The Three Options You Always Have in Life In any situation in life, you only have three options. You always have three options. You can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. What is not a good option is to sit around wishing you would change it but not changing it, wishing you would leave it but not leaving it, and not accepting it. Its that struggle, that aversion, that is responsible for most of our misery. The phrase that I probably use the most to myself in my head is just one word accept. The Five Chimps Theory Theres a theory that I call the five chimps theory. In zoology, you can predict the mood and behavior patterns of any chimp by which five chimps they hang out with the most. Choose your five chimps carefully. Lessons From Physics and the Russian Mob I learned the importance of honesty from a couple of different places. One is, when I grew up, I wanted to be a physicist and I idolized Richard Feynman. I read everything by him, technical and nontechnical, that I could get my hands on. He said You must never, ever fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. So the physics grounding is very important because in physics, you have to speak truth. You dont compromise, you dont negotiate with people, you dont try and make them feel better. If your equation is wrong, it just wont work. Truth is not determined by consensus or popularityusually, its quite the opposite. So I think the science background is important. A second is, I grew up around some really roughandtumble kids in New York, some of whom were actually in the Russian mob. I once had an encounter where I watched one of them threaten to kill the other. The wouldbe victim went and hid, and then finally, he let the aggressor into his house after the aggressor promised him No, Im not going to kill you. Honesty was such a strong virtue between them that even when they were ready to kill each other, they would take each others word for things. It went above everything. Even though it was honesty in a mob context, I realized how important that is in relationships. Honesty as Core Foundational Value Heres a brief story for comedic relief, and keep in mind that we both happily live in San Francisco. TIM You never hesitate to say whats on your mind. I can see how that might be misinterpreted by people who are used to polite, uhhuh, nodnod conversation. I remember once, you and I were both invited to a dinner, and there were a lot of people neither of us had met. You were standing in a group chatting over wine, and I showed up with this pretty unusual getup. I had on this turquoise longsleeved shirt, which I never wore. I dont know if you remember this. NAVAL I do not. TIM I had jeans on, and these brown, oddlooking dress shoes that kind of looked like bowling shoes. You looked at me, smiled, and asked, Why are you dressed like a gay banker? Then, this woman that neither of us had ever met started defending me, and I was like, Oh God, here we go. . . . NAVAL The honesty thing is a core foundational value. TIM In fairness, I totally did.

Its a little tabletop grill search Presto 22inch electric griddle. What I learned is that for food, the freshness and quality of the food going straight from the grill to your mouth is way more important than what you do with it. For example, in most recipes, we sauce the heck out of everything, we cream it, we overprepare it, and we overprocess it because its sitting under a heat lamp for 10 minutes. What would you put on a billboard? I dont know if I have messages to send to the world, but there are messages I like to send to myself at all times. One message that really stuck with me when I figured this out is Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. I dont think most of us realize thats what it is. I think we go about desiring things all day long, and then wondering why were unhappy. So, I like to stay aware of that because then I can choose my desires very carefully. I try not to have more than one big desire in my life at any given time, and I also recognize that as the axis of my suffering. I realize that thats where Ive chosen to be unhappy. I think that is an important one. TF Naval first encountered a variation of the above bolded text on a nowextinct blog called Delusion Damage. Navals Laws The below is Navals response to the question Are there any quotes you live by or think of often? These are gold. Take the time necessary to digest them. These arent all quotes from others. Many are maxims that Ive carved for myself. Be present above all else. Desire is suffering Buddha. Anger is a hot coal that you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at someone else Buddhist saying. If you cant see yourself working with someone for life, dont work with them for a day. Reading learning is the ultimate metaskill and can be traded for anything else. All the real benefits in life come from compound interest. Earn with your mind, not your time. 99 of all effort is wasted. Total honesty at all times. Its almost always possible to be honest and positive. Praise specifically, criticize generally Warren Buffett. Truth is that which has predictive power. Watch every thought. Always ask, Why am I having this thought? All greatness comes from suffering. Love is given, not received. Enlightenment is the space between your thoughts Eckhart Tolle. Mathematics is the language of nature. Every moment has to be complete in and of itself. A Few of Navals Tweets that are Too Good to Leave Out What you choose to work on, and who you choose to work with, are far more important than how hard you work. Free education is abundant, all over the Internet. Its the desire to learn thats scarce. If you eat, invest, and think according to what the news advocates, youll end up nutritionally, financially, and morally bankrupt. We waste our time with shortterm thinking and busywork. Warren Buffett spends a year deciding and a day acting. That act lasts decades. The guns arent new. The violence isnt new. The connected cameras are new, and that changes everything. You get paid for being right first, and to be first, you cant wait for consensus. My one repeated learning in life There are no adults. Everyones making it up as they go along. Figure it out yourself, and do it. A busy mind accelerates the passage of subjective time.

Glenn Beck Glenn Beck FBTW glennbeck, glennbeck.com hit rock bottom as an alcoholic in his 30s and restarted his life. Fast forward to 2014, Forbes named him to their annual Celebrity 100 Power List and pegged his earnings at 90 million for that year. This placed him ahead of people like Mark Burnett, Jimmy Fallon, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will Smith. Glenns platformsincluding radio, television, digital TheBlaze.com, publishing, etc.receive somewhere between 30 and 50 million unique visitors per month. The goal of my podcast is to push listeners outside of their comfort zones and force them to question assumptions. I regularly invite divergent thinkers who disagree with one another. This interview came about thanks to a latenight sauna session with an old friend, a mixedrace Brown University grad who is liberal in nearly every sense of the word. I casually asked him, If you could pick one person to be on the podcast, who would it be? He answered without a moments hesitation. Glenn Beck. His story is FASCINATING. And it was. . . . The Most Important Lesson Glenn Learned in Radio If I have to pick one, the best thing I learned, I learned by mistake. Somebody calls in to the radio show in the early days and said Glenn Beck, youre Mr. Perfect, like youve ever done anything wrong. You just cant accept a flaw in anybody. I stood there for a while and the room got really quiet. And I said, You know, let me tell you something. You dont have any idea who I even am, or the bad things that I have done. Let me tell you who I am. And I spent about 15 minutes being unbelievably, brutally honest and laying out who I am. The worst. No apology, nothing. Just saying You think you know? Ive been lying to you. This is who I am. I turned off my mic and I looked at my thenintern, the lowest producer on the ladder whos now my executive producer. I said to him, Mark this down on your calendar. Today is the day Glenn Beck ended his career. The opposite happened. I had grown up in a world where everything was manufactured, everything was written, timed, produced perfectly. What I realized that day was people are starving for something authentic. Theyll accept you, warts and all, if thats who you really are. Once you start lying to them, theyre not interested. Were all alike. So the best advice I learned by mistake, and that is Be willing to fail or succeed on who you really are. Dont ever try to be anything else. What you are is good enough for whatever it is youre doing. Righteous Doesnt Mean Radical Glenn recounted what he learned from an old lady who, at age 16, gave a Jew a bowl of soup. It was a death sentence at the time and she was sent to Auschwitz She said, Glenn, remember, the righteous didnt suddenly become righteous. They just refused to go over the cliff with everybody else. Thats all we have to do Know what our principlesnot our interestsare today. And as the world goes over the cliff, Im not going to change my principles. Treating human beings, whether theyre like me or not like me, whether theyre the same religion or a different religion, with love and respect.

Spirit animal Panther Tara Brach Tara Brach FB TaraBrach, tarabrach.com is a PhD in clinical psychology and one of the leading teachers of Buddhist thinking and meditation in the Western world. She is the founder of the Insight Meditation Community of Washington in Washington, D.C., and her lectures are downloaded hundreds of thousands of times each month at tarabrach.com. I was first introduced to Tara by Maria Popova page 406, who said, Tara has changed my life, perhaps more profoundly than anybody in my life. I then read Taras first book, Radical Acceptance, after it was recommended to me by a neuroscience PhD who worked with Adam Gazzaley page 135. I digested 10 pages each night in the tub, and it immediately had a huge impact. So much so that I initially stopped reading after 20 to testdrive the lessons in real life. There was a lot to work with. Perhaps my favorite lesson, excerpted below, is Inviting Mara to Tea. It relates to actively recognizing anger and other types of what we consider negative emotions. Rather than trying to suppress something or swat it away, we say to the emotionourselves, I see you. This counterintuitively helps to dissolve or resolve the issue. For instance, if youre meditating and anger comes up, maybe the memory of some personal slight, you might silently repeat anger, anger to yourself and acknowledge it, which allows you to quickly return to whatever your focus is. Ive always been a fighter, and calm acknowledgment doesnt come naturally to me, which makes it all the more valuable. Fighting emotions is like flailing in quicksandit only makes things worse. Sometimes, the most proactive defense is a mental nod and wink. Inviting Mara to Tea This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival. A joy, a depression, a meanness, Some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! . . . The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in. Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond. Rumi One of my favorite stories of the Buddha shows the power of a wakeful and friendly heart. The night before his enlightenment, the Buddha fought a great battle with the Demon God Mara, who attacked the thenbodhisattva Siddhartha Gautama with everything he had lust, greed, anger, doubt, etc. Having failed, Mara left in disarray on the morning of the Buddhas enlightenment. Yet, it seems Mara was only temporarily discouraged. Even after the Buddha had become deeply revered throughout India, Mara continued to make unexpected appearances. The Buddhas loyal attendant, Ananda, always on the lookout for any harm that might come to his teacher, would report with dismay that the Evil One had again returned. Instead of ignoring Mara or driving him away, the Buddha would calmly acknowledge his presence, saying, I see you, Mara. He would then invite him for tea and serve him as an honored guest. Offering Mara a cushion so that he could sit comfortably, the Buddha would fill two earthen cups with tea, place them on the low table between them, and only then take his own seat. Mara would stay for a while and then go, but throughout the Buddha remained free and undisturbed. When Mara visits us, in the form of troubling emotions or fearsome stories, we can say, I see you, Mara, and clearly recognize the reality of craving and fear that lives in each human heart. By accepting these experiences with the warmth of compassion, we can offer Mara tea rather than fearfully drive him away. Seeing what is true, we hold what is seen with kindness. We express such wakefulness of heart each time we recognize and embrace our hurts and fears. Our habit of being a fairweather friend to ourselvesof pushing away or ignoring whatever darkness we canis deeply entrenched. But just as a relationship with a good friend is marked by understanding and compassion, we can learn to bring these same qualities to our own inner life.

We express such wakefulness of heart each time we recognize and embrace our hurts and fears. Our habit of being a fairweather friend to ourselvesof pushing away or ignoring whatever darkness we canis deeply entrenched. But just as a relationship with a good friend is marked by understanding and compassion, we can learn to bring these same qualities to our own inner life. Pema Chdrn says that through spiritual practice, We are learning to make friends with ourselves, our life, at the most profound level possible. We befriend ourselves when, rather than resisting our experience, we open our hearts and willingly invite Mara to tea. The key in a restaurant, and the key in any kind of highpressure situation, I think, is that 75 of success is staying calm and not losing your nerve. The rest you figure out, but once you lose your calm, everything else starts falling apart fast. Sam Kass Sam Kass TW chefsamkass, troveworldwide.com almost became a pro baseball player. Instead, he pivoted a history major from the University of Chicago into becoming the private chef for the Obamas. He then became the senior White House policy advisor for nutrition and was named 11 on Fast Company magazines 2011 list of 100 Most Creative People for his work, which focused on establishing privatesector partnerships to reduce childhood obesity to just 5 by 2030. Sam was the first person in the history of the White House to have a position both in the Executive Office of the President and the Residence. He is now a founding partner of Trove, which connects businesses, organizations, and governments that are serious about making an impact on the world with the people and tools to help them achieve it. From His First SousChefTwo Rules for the Kitchen and Life The first is Never serve anything you wouldnt want to eat. Never serve crap. Its Rule Number 1. You can have a high standard on everything. Rule Number 2 When things get really busy, instead of just plowing ahead, trying to work as fast as you can, and just going through all the tickets, he always would tell me, Step back and come up with a plan. Look at what dishes you have, and figure out the most efficient way to cook them. So, if you have five of one thing, dont just cook them one at a time. Get them out, prep them together, and do them together. Pros Use Acid One difference between home cooks and pros is acidity level. When you think its ready, add another lemon. Pros bump up the acidity level. Its one of the secrets. We add a little more acid, and it makes everything taste better. The Secret to Great Eggs Eggs are one of the hardest things to cook. Some of the great chefs in the world, their test for a new cook would be how to make an omelet. That would be their one master test. So, I actually like eggs all ways, but almost always soft, like a softboiled egg. Ill do eggs over easy or really soft scrambled eggs. The trick for soft scrambled eggs isafter you get your butter knives outI crack the eggs straight into the pan, let them cook for a second, and then mix them up. Then, before you think theyre done, take them out because theyll harden a little bit as they sit on the plate. TF In the last few years, Ive developed a love affair with softboiled eggs, which can be a decadent indulgence if done right. Heres my approach 1 Bring water to a boil. 2 Gently add eggs and set timer for exactly 5 minutes. 3 Manage the heat so its a gentle bubbling boil, not a violent lava pit. 4 At 5 minutes, pour out the hot water and replace with cold tap water. 5 Remove, peel, and enjoy. Advice to your younger self at college graduation? Passion is an overstated word. I think passion develops. . . . I threw myself into food, and although I was passionate about it, it wasnt a life passion until I combined food and nourishment with health, sustainability, politics, policy, and what were doing to really help make sure that all people can live healthy, productive, awesome lives through the food that theyre eating. That is what became that passion. . . . A lot of people say, Find your passion. I think passion comes from a combination of being open and curious, and of really going allin when you find something that youre interested in.

You Want to Be Taken Seriously? Then Take Things Seriously Toby Orenstein was a great director. . . . If youre lucky, you have someone when youre young who doesnt talk down to you, who speaks to you as a serious person and exhorts you to take something seriously, to take work seriously. If a person does that in the right way, you feel elevated. As a young person, you feel like someone is saying to you, Hey! You want to be taken seriously? Then take things seriously. Do the work, you know? Dont coast, you know? Id say thats what she gave. One of Edwards recommended essays The Catastrophe of Success by Tennessee Williams. TF One of my favorite lines from this piece is For me, a convenient place to work is a remote place among strangers where there is good swimming. Edwards favorite documentaries Bennett Millers The Cruise and Adam Curtiss films. Hes got a fourpart film called The Century of the Self, and then a threepart series called The Power of Nightmares. I think those are absolutely brilliant films, dense but really eyeopening. TF The Century of the Self has been recommended to me by several podcast guests. Three favorite recent films? Of late, Im a huge fan of the French filmmaker Jacques Audiard. I think, in the last few years, he put up a hat trick of films The Beat That My Heart Skipped, A Prophet, and Rust and Bone. TF A Prophet is now one of my favorite films. If you like gangster movies, it is violently gorgeous and teaches a lot of leadership lessons. Marlon Brando Real Genius Versus Faked Genius One of the best stories I ever heard about young people in an acting class, and the difference between what happens to people typically and what a real, authentic kind of genius is relates to Marlon Brando. Harry Belafonte talked about being in an acting class with Marlon. They were both 19 or 20 years old in Greenwich Village. The organizers of the class said, Okay. One persons in his apartment, and the other one enters. Youre the person whos on your couch in your apartment. Just run with it. People were doing all kinds of forced conversations or trying to create a scenario. . . . Supposedly, Marlon sat on the couch and started reading a magazine, and whoever it was walked in his door. He looked up, jumped up, grabbed the guy by the shirt front, threw him out the door, and slammed the door. Everybody was like, What are you doing? He said, I dont know who that fucking guy is. He just walked into my apartment. He scared the shit out of me. You know what I mean? Its like, Wait a minute. Yeah, there probably wouldnt be a scene. There probably wouldnt be a conversation. Wine is a grocery, not a luxury. Spirit animal Spinner dolphin Richard Betts Richard Betts TW yobetts, myessentialwine.com served as the wine director at The Little Nell in Aspen from 2000 to 2008.

THE BEGINNING OF RICHARDS WINE ADVENTURE Richard was on track to become a lawyer, and . . . he hated it. Many years earlier, hed spent time in Italy. Then When I was in grad school in Flagstaff, I was clerking for a small environmental firm. I found it didnt matter whether you were doing environmental, or you were doing bankruptcyit was the same Monopoly board, making the same motions, pass Park Place every time.

Instead, I walked out of the lab, hopped over the fence, and ran across Route 66 there in Flagstaff to a small restaurantwine store. I didnt know anything about wine. I just knew that I drank it daily in Italy and how much that meant to me. I walked in and I bought totally based on sight . . . I thought, I kind of recognize that label, and I took it home, popped the cork, and poured a glass. That first smell took me back to a moment almost four years earlier when living in Italy.

What are a few underpriced or underrated wines? Grenache from Rusden, Zinfandel from Turley, and Chenin Blanc from Mosse. And dont forget Try smelling with your mouth open, as youll get more information. EXPLAINING His Be Nice Tattoo, Which Started as the Letter B It was a note to self to just be kind, be thoughtful, benevolent . . . just be a good guy. Sometimes, I thrash about, and its a little reminder. Note to self. It grew into Be nice, plain and simple. Culinary SchoolA PotatoestoPotatoes Comparison I went and talked to a chef, and I said, This is what Im thinking about . . . Im either going to ask you for a job or Im thinking about culinary school. He said, Heres the deal. You can come here today, and you can ask me for a job, and Ill say, Yeah, great. Here are the potatoes. Get peeling. Or you can go to culinary school, spend two more years of your life preparing, spending 30K or 40K a year in bills to be there, then, you can come to me and ask me for a job, and Ill say, Yeah, sure. Heres a big pot of potatoes. Get peeling. Same thing. I was like, Okay, Im pretty good at math. I got this. Where are the potatoes? Lets do it. So it was that simple. Going on OffenseDeliberately Avoiding the Hotbeds for Better Access There were these two chefs I wanted to work for in Tucson, who are greatwell regarded on a national level. Nobody wanted to move there to work with them, so if I went, I could get immediate access and supercharge my learning and my path. So I did. I went to that second chef, and I said, Hey, man, I want to work with you. This is why Im in Arizona, and he said, Great. What have you been doing? TF Richard got the job. This is very similar to the going on offense philosophy and decisionmaking of Chris Sacca page 164, who first introduced me to Richard. Competition is overrated see Peter Thiel, page 232, and sometimes you can you push a rock downhill instead of uphill see Seth Godin, page 237. Dont Work for the Awards, Make the Awards Work for You TIM What do you think financially successful people who are generally unhappy have in common? RICHARD Misplaced goals. I think chasing the financial is not the right way to do it. That first chef who gave me that first wine job, he was great. We were overlooked for a couple of things in the press, and Im new in this food and wine world. He said, Look, Richard, if you work for the awards, you dont do good work. But if you do good work, the awards will come. Advice to your 25yearold self? Dont be so fucking shy. . . . Dude, I can still think of instances within the last 24 months where I think, Man, Richard, I wish you had been more forward. I wish you had asked for X instead of being so subtle and implying it. I try to go for that subtle, elegant thing, which sounds really nice. I think part of that is actually being shy. Sometimes, the clues that you put outwardly are too subtle to be heard, or someone is just talking louder than you. I think youre a spectacularly good teacher. If you were teaching a ninthgrade class, what would you teach? Love yourself . . . Youve got to love yourself before you can love others. Without it, nothing productive is going to happen, and we can all bang our heads on the wall.

Mike wrote down, Art is socialism but life is capitalism, and that became a guiding principle for his film Dont Think Twice. Only Emotion Endures Mike corkboards his walls and pins 3x5 cards to them. One of his favorites is just three words from Ezra Pound, which Mike considers one of the best quotes for writing Only emotion endures. Silence Sometimes Speaks Louder Than Words TIM With someone like Ira Glass, or anyone else, is there a particular way that you elicit feedback to make it as helpful as possible? MIKE Usually, I will tell people bits and jokes over the phone, partly because they can peacefully give feedback in a way thats not judgmental.

On the phone, its pretty easy to skim through stuff, and I can hear when people are interested by whats being said.

How to Approach Celebrities and Get President Obama to Say Poo I met President Obama 2 years ago, when my wife was pregnant. Our whole thing was, whenever we meet someone who we know doesnt care about meeting us, my wife and I always try and come up with a trick question that throws them off.

Just say something like What do you think of kiwi? and he wont be able to not be like, I love kiwi! Talk to people about a thing they didnt think they were going to talk about.

The president of the United States couldnt help but say, Well, am I first to know? And my wife says yes. She asks, Do you have any parenting advice? And he says, Well, get some sleep.

And he goes, And when you bring him home, babies crave structure in their eating and in their sleeping. Breastfeeding doesnt always work out right away. Theres going to be a little bit of wonky. Dont freak out. And if the sleeping doesnt work out right away, dont freak out. And he paused and he thought about it and he goes, Thats actually some pretty good advice. He complimented his own advice. Im telling you, the best thing to do is give people questions theyre not expecting. Advice to your 20yearold self? I would say, Write everything down because its all very fleeting. I would say, Keep a journal, which I have but I would have been more meticulous. Then I would say, Dont bow to the gatekeepers at the head of, in my case, show business, but at the gate of any business or any endeavor. Dont bow to the gatekeepers because I think, in essence, there are no gatekeepers. You are the gatekeeper. . . . Dont waste your time on marketing, just try to get better. . . . And also, its not about being good its about being great. Because what I find, the older I get, is that a lot of people are good, and a lot of people are smart, and a lot of people are clever. But not a lot of people give you their soul when they perform. The Jar of Awesome This was not my idea. It is thanks to an exgirlfriend who is a real sweetheart. She made and gave me the Jar of Awesome as a gift, because Im very good at achievement and historically not good at appreciation. Heres how it works There is a mason jar on my kitchen counter with jar of awesome in glitter letters on the side. Anytime something really cool happens in a day, something that made me excited or joyful, doctors orders are to write it down on a slip of paper and put it in this mason jar. When something great happens, you think youll remember it 3 months later, but you wont. The Jar of Awesome creates a record of great things that actually happened, all of which are easy to forget if youre depressed or seeing the world through graycolored glasses. I tend to celebrate very briefly, if at all, so this pays dividends for weeks, months, or years. The Jar of Awesome has had a tremendous impact on my quality of life. It sounds ridiculous to admit and my 20yearold self would probably vomit, butmanit works. I keep the jar where I will see it constantly. Each time the name catches my eye, a little voice in my head says, Things arent so bad, Eeyore. Perk the fuck up! I came to realize that A If youre serious all the time, youll wear out before the truly serious stuff gets done and B if you dont regularly appreciate the small wins, you will never appreciate the big wins. Theyll all fall through your fingers like sand as you obsess on the next week, the next todo, the next thing to fix. This makes success a Pyrrhic victory at best. Now, if you dont want to have a jar with Jar of Awesome written on it, you could just put a huge star or exclamation point on the side. However, the more serious you are in real life, the more ridiculous I think you should make it. Who are you trying to impress? If you have kids, get them involved. Many of my fans now have their entire families developing gratitude using this simple, lowtech godsend. Cultivate the habit of putting something in every day. Cant think of anything? I didnt die today! is a reliable winner. Thats totally awesome compared to the alternative. Look for the good, practice finding the good, and youll see it more often.

I had a cappuccino and a third of a croissant. I love croissants, but I think one should eat the absolute minimum in the morning. . . . Thats one of my rules. On lapsang souchong black tea Some people smell it, and they just run in the opposite direction. They dont even think its tea. Theres a little coffee shop where I often go in the morning, and they have it. I think Im one of the only people who orders it. TF Lapsang souchong has a very smoky, peaty flavor. It reminds one of my friends so much of whisky that he used it to cut back on drinking alcohol. How do you decide how to start a chapter or book? Its not a math question where theres only one answer. So, as long as you understand there is not just one good answer, it takes the pressure off. Typically, I might try out several openings. Its made easier by the fact that I dont start at the beginning. Once you dont start at the beginning, your life just gets so much simpler. TF Search 5 great examples of in medias res for more on this approach. In medias res literally means into the middle things in Latin and refers to beginning a story chapter, novel, movie, video game, whatever in the middle or at the end of the narrative. Ive done this with all of my previous books. How Malcolm Learned to Ask Questions His father, a mathematician, taught Malcolm to ask questions upon questions My father has zero intellectual insecurities. . . . It has never crossed his mind to be concerned that the world thinks hes an idiot. Hes not in that game. So if he doesnt understand something, he just asks you. He doesnt care if he sounds foolish. He will ask the most obvious question without any sort of concern about it. . . . So he asks lots and lots of dumb, in the best sense of that word, questions. Hell say to someone, I dont understand. Explain that to me. Hell just keep asking questions until he gets it right, and I grew up listening to him do this in every conceivable setting. If my father had met Bernie Madoff, he never would have invested money with him because he would have said, I dont understand a hundred times. I dont understand how that works, in this kind of dumb, slow voice. I dont understand, sir. What is going on? See Alex Blumberg, page 303. Malcolms role models in the public speaking world Niall Ferguson, the historian, gave a birthday toast, which is just the best toast Ive ever heard in my life. It was so much better than anything Id ever heard. It was on another level. Whats bad advice that you hear being given out often? The worst advice that, in general, we give in America is that we terrify high school kids about their college choices. All things related to college fall under the category of bad advice. As you will find out when you listen to my rants about college on Revisionist History, I think the American college system needs to be blown up and they need to start over. . . . Am I so inspired by what I learned during the day that I want to be talking about it at 100 in the morning? And do I have someone who will have that conversation with me and who will challenge me? Thats it. Everything else is nonsense.

When to Put Away Your Moral Compass If you want to solve a problemany problem that you care enough about to want to solveyou almost certainly come to it with a whole lot of ideas about it. Ideas about why its an important problem, what is it that bothers you exactly, who the villains are in the problem, etc. So if youre an environmentalist, and you believe that one of the biggest tragedies of the last 100 years is people despoiling the environment, the minute you hear about an issue that kind of abuts the environment, whether its honeybee collapse or something having to do with air quality, your immediate moral position is, Well, I know exactly what the cause of that is. Its caused by people being stupid and careless and greedy and so on. Now that may be true, but it also may not be true. Our point is, if you try to approach every problem with your moral compass, first and foremost, youre going to make a lot of mistakes. Youre going to exclude a lot of possible good solutions. Youre going to assume you know a lot of things, when in fact you dont, and youre not going to be a good partner in reaching a solution with other people who dont happen to see the world the way you do. Whats the worst advice you hear often? Write what you know. Why would I want to write about what little I know? Dont I want to use writing to learn more? On Vetting Brainstormed Ideas Some of them just turned out to not be so interesting. Some of them we didnt really believe in. Some of them turned out to be interesting and true, but they didnt have any data or stories that really illustrated them . . . so our brainstorming was Lets come up with as many ideas as possible, and then put them under scrutiny, and basically try to kill them off, and if they were unkillable, then wed keep going with them. Three sources youve learned from or followed closely in the last year? Online Marginal Revolution, Kottke.org, and Cool Tools by Kevin Kelly, page 470. Advice to your younger self? I would say its pretty simple Dont be scared. There are a lot of things I did not do, a lot of experiences I never tried, a lot of people I never met or hung out with because I was, in some form, intimidated or scared. . . . It also plays into what psychologists call the spotlight effect, as if everybody must be caring about what I do. And the fact is Nobody gives a crap what I do. Spirit animal Gorilla Josh Waitzkin Josh Waitzkin joshwaitzkin.com was the basis for the book and movie Searching for Bobby Fischer. Considered a chess prodigy, he has perfected learning strategies that can be applied to anything, including his other loves of Brazilian jiujitsu hes a black belt under phenom Marcelo Garcia and tai chi push hands hes a world champion. These days, he spends his time coaching the worlds top athletes and investors, working to revolutionize education, and tackling his new passion of paddle surfing, often nearly killing me in the process. I first met Josh after reading his book, The Art of Learning, and weve become dear friends. Empty Space Josh has no social media, does no interviews except my podcast, for which he often says to me, You fuck!, and avoids nearly all meetings and phone calls. He minimizes input to maximize output, much like Rick Rubin. Josh says I cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process. Learning the Macro from the Micro Josh focuses on depth over breadth. He often uses a principle nicknamed learning the macro from the micro. This means focusing on something very small in a field whether chess, martial arts, or elsewhere to internalize extremely powerful macro principles that apply everywhere. This is sometimes combined with beginning with the endgame. For instance, when Josh gave me a beginners tutorial on chess, he didnt start with opening moves. Memorizing openings is natural, and nearly everyone does it, but Josh likens it to stealing the test answers from a teacher. Youre not learning principles or strategiesyoure merely learning a few tricks that will help you beat your novice friends. Instead, Josh took me in reverse, just as his first teacher, Bruce Pandolfini, did with him. The board was empty, except for three pieces in an endgame scenario king and pawn against king. Through the micro, positions of reduced complexity, he was able to focus me on the macro principles like the power of empty space, opposition, and setting an opponent up for zugzwang a situation where any move he makes will destroy his position. By limiting me to a few simple pieces, he hoped I would learn something limitless highlevel concepts I could apply anytime against anyone.

Ive seen him apply this to many things, including teaching jiujitsu, where he can cover nearly all of the principles of jiujitsu by focusing on a single submission endgame called the guillotine specifically Marcelotine. If Youre Studying My Game, Youre Entering My Game Josh and I spend a lot of time discussing Marcelo Garcia, 5time world champion in Brazilian jiujitsu, with whom Josh owns the Marcelo Garcia Academy in New York City. Marcelo is arguably the best grappler of the last 100 years, the combined Mike Tyson, Wayne Gretzky, and Michael Jordan of his sport. Whereas most competitors are secretive about their competition prep, Marcelo routinely records and uploads his sparring sessions, his exact training for major events. Josh explains the rationale Marcelo was visually showing these competitors what he was about to use against them at 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks away from competition, and his attitude about this was just completely unique If youre studying my game, youre entering my game, and Ill be better at it than you. TF I often share exact underthehood details of how Ive built the podcast, put together Kickstarter campaigns, etc. I do this because of two core beliefs. Belief 1Its rarely a zerosum game if someone wins, someone else must lose, and the more I help people with details, the more detailed help I receive. Belief 2If it is competitive, Im simply offering people the details of my game. My attention to detail will scare off half of the people who would have tried 40 will try it and be worse than me 10 will try it and be better than me, but . . . see Belief 1. That 10 will often reach out to teach me what theyve learned, as theyre grateful for my own transparency. Remember the Last Three Turns I remember when I went skiing with Billy Kidd, who is one of the great Olympic downhill racers from back in the 1960s. Hes an awesome dude. Now he skis out in Colorado wearing a cowboy hat . . . and he asked me years ago when I first skied with him, Josh, what do you think are the three most important turns of the ski run? Ive asked that question to a lot of people since. Most people will say the middle because its the hardest or the beginning because of momentum, but he describes the three most important turns of a ski run as the last three before you get on the lift. Its a very subtle point. For those of you who are skiers, thats when the slope is leveled off, theres less challenge. Most people are very sloppy then . . . they have bad form. The problem is that on the lift ride up, unconsciously, youre internalizing bad body mechanics. As Billy points out, if your last three turns are precise, then what youre internalizing on the lift ride up is precision. So I carry this on to the guys who I train in the finance world, for example ending the work day with very high quality, which for one thing means youre internalizing quality overnight. TF Thanks to Josh, I now always end training sessions on a good rep, whether AcroYoga, gymnastics, archery, or other. For instance, even if I have 60 minutes budgeted for a workout, if I hit a fantastic PR personal record at 45 minutes, or do something new well, I pack it in. In the case of archery, I also use blank bale practice, where I start and end all sessions with 5 to 6 arrows shot by feel alone, eyes closed, into a target that is a mere 10 feet away. This is similar to dry firing with firearms. One of Joshs favorite writers, Hemingway, had a practice of ending his writing sessions midflow and midsentence. This way, he knew exactly where to start the next day, and he could reliably both end and start his sessions with confidence. To Turn It On, Learn to Turn It off And Vice Versa One of my most beautiful memories of Marcelo is in the world championship, right before going to the semifinals. Hes napping on a bleacher. Everyones screaming and yelling, and hes asleep on the bleacher. I cant wake him up. He finally took a stumble into the ring, and youve never seen a guy more relaxed before going into a world championship fight. . . . He can turn it off so deeply, and man, when he goes in the ring, you cant turn it on with any more intensity than he can. His ability to turn it off is directly aligned with how intensely he can turn it on, so I train people to do this, to have stress and recovery undulation throughout their day.

Interval training often at midday or lunch break and meditation together are beautiful habits to develop to cultivate the art of turning it on and turning it off. The Little Things Are the Big Things Were talking about Marcelo embodying the principle of quality in all these little ways e.g., specific cleaning protocols for the gym, having people tidy their uniforms in class. These little ways, you could say dont matter, but they add up to matter hugely. TIM Oh, I think the little things are the big things. Because theyre a reflection. This may sound clichd, but how you do anything is how you do everything. JOSH Its such a beautiful and critical principle, and most people think they can wait around for the big moments to turn it on. But if you dont cultivate turning it on as a way of life in the little momentsand there are hundreds of times more little moments than bigthen theres no chance in the big moments. . . . I believe that when youre not cultivating quality, youre essentially cultivating sloppiness. Just Go Around for Life Lateral thinking or thematic thinking, the ability to take a lesson from one thing and transfer it to another, is one of the most important disciplines that any of us can cultivate. From a really young age, we my wife and I began to cultivate this in our toddler son, Jack around this principle of go around. The first time, we were staying in a little cottage in Marthas Vineyard in a big field, and he was trying to get in one door. He couldnt, but he could get in the other door, and I said, Jack, go around. He looked at me and he went around. Then go around became language for us, in terms of solving puzzles and in terms of any time you run into an obstacle. Working with the metaphor of go around opened up this way that we could just have dialogue around connecting thingstaking away a principle from one thing and applying it to something elseand weve had a lot of fun with that. Embrace Your Funk Thats a term from my buddy, Graham Duncan a successful manager of a fund of funds, whos a dear friend of ours whos come on our surf adventures. Hes a brilliant thought partner . . . you think about the entanglement of genius and madness, our brilliance and eccentricity. Understanding that entanglement is a precursor to working with anybody whos trying to be worldclass at something, because the entanglement is fundamental to their being. They have to, ultimately, embrace their funk, embrace their eccentricity, embrace what makes them different, and then build on it. Who do you pick when your ego seems threatened? Back in the world of combat sports and jiujitsu Its very interesting to observe who the top competitors pick out when theyre five rounds into the sparring sessions and theyre completely gassed. The ones who are on the steepest growth curve look for the hardest guy therethe one who might beat them upwhile others look for someone they can take a break on. The Importance of Language on a Rainy Day One of the biggest mistakes that I observed in the first year of Jacks life was parents who have unproductive language around weather being good or bad. Whenever it was raining, youd hear moms, babysitters, dads say, Its bad weather. We cant go out, or if it wasnt, Its good weather. We can go out. That means that, somehow, were externally reliant on conditions being perfect in order to be able to go out and have a good time. So, Jack and I never missed a single storm, rain or snow, to go outside and romp in it. Maybe we missed one when he was sick. Weve developed this language around how beautiful it is. Now, whenever its a rainy day, Jack says, Look, Dada, its such a beautiful rainy day, and we go out and we play in it. I wanted him to have this internal locus of controlto not be reliant on external conditions being just so. Why You Need a Deloading Phase in Life My daily journaling isnt limited to mornings. I use it as a tool to clarify my thinking and goals, much as Kevin Kelly page 470 does. The paper is like a photography darkroom for my mind. This chapter shares is a transcription of a real entry from October 2015.

I wanted him to have this internal locus of controlto not be reliant on external conditions being just so. Why You Need a Deloading Phase in Life My daily journaling isnt limited to mornings. I use it as a tool to clarify my thinking and goals, much as Kevin Kelly page 470 does. The paper is like a photography darkroom for my mind. This chapter shares is a transcription of a real entry from October 2015. It was written in Samovar Tea Lounge in San Francisco after a 2hour walk and led me to reincorporate deloading phases in my life. Deloading is a concept used in strength and athletic training, but it can be applied to many things. Lets look at the sports definition, here from the website T Nation A backoff week, or deload, is a planned reduction in exercise volume or intensity. In collegiate strengthtraining circles, its referred to as the unloading week, and is often inserted between phases or periods. Quoting from Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning The purpose of this unloading week is to prepare the body for the increased demand of the next phase or period, and to mitigate the risk of overtraining. So, how might this relate to creativity, productivity, or quality of life? Lets start with a personal outcome In the last 12 months, Ive used deloading outside of sports to decrease my anxiety at least 50 while simultaneously doubling my income. Deloading for business, in my case, consists of strategically taking my foot off of the gas. I alternate intense periods of batching similar tasks recording podcasts, clearing the inbox, writing blog posts, handling accounting, etc. with extended periods offor lack of poetic descriptionunplugging and fucking around. The unplug can still be intense search 4hour reality check for an example, but you shouldnt be working on work. Lets dig into the journal entry, as it provides much of the reasoning. Ive added some additional thoughts below it TUESSAMOVAR 540PM The great deloading phase. This is what Im experiencing this afternoon, and it makes a Tuesday feel like a lazy Sunday morning. This is when the muse is most likely to visit. I need to get back to the slack. To the pregnant void of infinite possibilities, only possible with a lack of obligation, or at least, no compulsive reactivity. Perhaps this is only possible with the negative space toas Kurt Vonnegut put itfart around? To do things for the hell of it? For no damn good reason at all? I feel that the big ideas come from these periods. Its the silence between the notes that makes the music. If you want to create or be anything lateral, bigger, better, or truly different, you need room to ask what if? without a conference call in 15 minutes. The aha moments rarely come from the incremental inboxclearing mentality of, Oh, fuck . . . I forgot to . . . Please remind me to . . . Shouldnt I? . . . I must remember to . . . Inbox land is the land of the lost, and we all become lost. My Tuesday experience reinforced, for me, the importance of creating large, uninterrupted blocks of time, during which your mind can wander, ponder, and find the signal amidst the noise. If youre lucky, it might even create a signal, or connect two signals core ideas that have never shaken hands before. Ive scheduled deloading phases in a few ways roughly 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. daily for journaling, tea routines, etc. 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. every Wednesday for creative output i.e., writing, interviewing for the podcast and screenfree Saturdays, when I use no laptops and only use my phone for maps and coordinating with friends via text no apps. Of course, I still use miniretirements la The 4Hour Workweek a few times a year. Deloading blocks must be scheduled and defended more strongly than your business commitments. The former can strengthen and inform the latter, but not vice versa. To sum up, how can one throttle back the reactive living that has them following everyones agenda except their own? Create slack, as no one will give it to you. This is the only way to swim forward instead of treading water.

BREN Lean into discomfort, because I think these seemingly impossible problems that we have around race and homophobia and the environment, and just the lack of love sometimes, are not going to be solved in a comfortable way. . . . So I guess my ask would be more of a big metaphysical ask Give vulnerability a shot. Give discomfort its due. Because I think he or she who is willing to be the most uncomfortable is not only the bravest, but rises the fastest. TF One of the most common Kindle highlights from The 4Hour Workweek complements this A persons success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. When I Had the Opportunity, Did I Choose Courage over Comfort? Bren flew under the radar for a long time, until she came across Theodore Roosevelts famous arena quote The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming. . . .. She decided to teach as a public figure, despite hurtful online comments and attacks. In that moment, what I realized is, you know what? I do want to live a brave life. I do want to live in the arena. And if youre going to live in the arena, the only guarantee is you will get your ass kicked. . . . Daring greatly is being vulnerable. So when you ask yourself, Did I dare greatly today? The big question I ask is, When I had the opportunity, did I choose courage over comfort? TF This is a great question for daily review as part of a 5Minute Journal or other evening journaling page 146. How That Translates to More Than 30 Million Video Views I went to the TED event and I experimented. I really put myself out there. I talked about my own breakdown, my spiritual awakening. I talked about having to go to therapy . . . and I remember driving home and thinking, I will never do that again. She then watched the popularity of her video explode, now totaling more than 31 million views on TED.com and YouTube. If I look back, my takeaway from that experience was this If Im not a little bit nauseous when Im done, I probably didnt show up like I should have shown up. One of Her Rules for Public Speaking House Lights I require that the house lights are on, so I can see peoples faces. I rarely allow any of my presentations to be videotaped. If theyre taping you, you have to be super hot bright under the lights, and the audience has to be dark. Then its performance, not connection, for me. Shame Versus Guilt Shame is I am a bad person. Guilt is I did something bad. . . . Shame is a focus on self. Guilt is a focus on behavior. To Be Trusted, Be Vulnerable One of the things that emerged from the data is this idea of trust and the relationship between trust and vulnerability. People always think you gain trust first and then youre vulnerable with people. But the truth is, you cant really earn trust over time with people without being somewhat vulnerable first. See Gabby Reeces advice to go first, page 94, and Neil Strausss preinterview approach, page 350. Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? I dont picture anybody. I picture the word redefine. The word successful or success has been such a dangerous word in my research. My answer is Be clear that your ladder is leaning against the right building. Advice to your 30yearold self? Its okay to be afraid. You dont have to be so scary when youre scared. . . . The 30s are so exhausting. Its the age of perfecting, proving, pretending. Everything came when I completely dove in fearlessly and made the content that I needed to make as a kind of artist . . . I got out of my own way. I stopped doubting myself, and the universe winked at me when I did that, so to speak.

I had left Al Gores Current TV in 2011 and was technically unemployed a former TV host with limited savings. Deciding to spend money on editing these videos without an income was a leap of faith. The first two videos were You Are a RCVR and The Beginning of Infinity. Both of these were essentially proofs of concept for what would become my signature digital media style philosophical espresso shots. I released both on Vimeo and immediately saw excitement and interest grow in my work. I knew I was onto something. Within months, I was being invited to give speeches and was eventually asked to make a video that opened TEDGlobal 2012. From there, things took off. A few months later, National Geographic became fans of the videos and invited me to host the TV series Brain Games, which was a huge global hit and garnered me an Emmy nomination. TF I love to study the early versions of current successes. Jason is quite polished, but the hatchling stages are often amusingly rough around the edges.

Go for Truth, and Youll Hit Funny Along the Way Before we started recording our interview in Jons office, he mentioned the best advice he got from one of his teachers, Glenn Close Dont go for funny. Go for the truth, and youll hit funny along the way. Tell the Truth. Its the Easiest Thing to Remember And Write Although Swingers wasnt really autobiographical, there were enough things that I could draw from. . . . Whats the expression from Glengarry Glen Ross? Always tell the truth. Its the easiest thing to remember. . . . If youre going to talk about a neighborhood, talk about the neighborhood you grew up in. Talk about the neighborhood you know. Even if its not you, youre going to have a more consistent world that youre developing than if youre putting them on Mars, and you dont understand Mars. Side note Jon wrote Swingers in roughly 2 weeks and it was eventually made for less than 200K. On Cooking and Bonding The first time I spent a day with Jon at his house, I was immediately invited to help make beignets as part of a group using a mix from Caf du Monde in New Orleans, for those curious. Jon explains why Here we were. We didnt really know each other that well.

Jon explains why Here we were. We didnt really know each other that well. Id read your stuff, you saw my stuff, and then lo and behold, you put some hot oil there, and the focus is no longer on each other. Its about keeping all your fingers. . . . Theres so little overlap with most people that I meet, which makes cooking great because it creates this context where everybody is on equal footing, and everybody has a different skill set. It becomes a real task where you become interdependent. I find I have endless patience to spend time with people I dont know very well, if youre working on a really intimate cooking project. Then at the end, we all serve it together, and we really feel like we fought a war together. Its a great bonding thing. The Power of Myth For screenwriting, Jon recommends The Writers Journey by Christopher Vogler, which he used to determine if Swingers was structurally correct. He is also a big fan of The Power of Myth, a video interview of Joseph Campbell by Bill Moyers. With The Jungle Book, I really am going back and doubling down on the old myths. TF We recorded our podcast during the shooting of The Jungle Book, in his production office next to set. Months later, The Jungle Book was the 1 movie in the world and currently has a staggering 95 review average on Rotten Tomatoes. LongTerm Impact Trumps ShortTerm Gross Thanks to video, and later DVD and laser disc, everybody had seen this film Swingers, and it had become part of our culture. Thats when I learned that its not always the movie that does the best financially that has the most impact, or is the most rewarding, or does the most for your career, for that matter. Another Reason to Meditate In the middle of a meditation session, the idea for Chef hit me, and I let myself stop, which I dont usually do, and I took out a pad. I scribbled down like eight pages of ideas and thoughts, and then I left it alone. If I look back on it, and read those pages, it really had 80 of the heavy lifting done, as far as what Chef was about, who was in it, who the characters were, what other movies to look at, what the tone was, what music I would have in it, what type of food he was making, the idea of the food truck, the Cuban sandwiches, Cuban music . . . so it all sort of grew out from that. Testing the Impossible 17 Questions that Changed My Life Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.Mark Twain Reality is largely negotiable. If you stresstest the boundaries and experiment with the impossibles, youll quickly discover that most limitations are a fragile collection of socially reinforced rules you can choose to break at any time. What follows are 17 questions that have dramatically changed my life. Each one is timestamped, as they entered the picture at precise moments. 1What if I did the opposite for 48 hours? In 2000, I was selling mass data storage to CEOs and CTOs in my first job out of college. When I wasnt driving my moms handmedown minivan to and from the office in San Jose, California, I was cold calling and cold emailing. Smiling and dialing was brutal. For the first few months, I flailed and failed it didnt help that my desk was wedged in a fire exit. Then, one day, I realized something All of the sales guys made their sales calls between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Obvious, right? But thats part one. Part two I realized that all of the gatekeepers who kept me from the decision makersCEOs and CTOsalso worked from 9 to 5. What if I did the opposite of all the other sales guys, just for 48 hours? I decided to take a Thursday and Friday and make sales calls only from 7 to 830 a.m. and 6 to 730 p.m. For the rest of the day, I focused on cold emails. It worked like gangbusters. The big boss often picked up the phone directly, and I began doing more experiments with What if I did the opposite? What if I only asked questions instead of pitching? What if I studied technical material, so I sounded like an engineer instead of a sales guy? What if I ended my emails with I totally understand if youre too busy to reply, and thank you for reading this far, instead of the usual I look forward to your reply and speaking soon presumptive BS? The experiments paid off. My last quarter in that job, I outsold the entire L.A. office of our biggest competitor, EMC. 2What do I spend a silly amount of money on? How might I scratch my own itch? In late 2000 and early 2001, I saw the writing on the wall The startup I worked for was going to implode. Rounds of layoffs started and werent going to end.

In late 2000 and early 2001, I saw the writing on the wall The startup I worked for was going to implode. Rounds of layoffs started and werent going to end. I wasnt sure what to do, but Id been bitten by the startup bug and intoxicated by Silicon Valley. To explore business opportunities, I didnt do indepth market research. I started with my credit card statement and asked myself, What do I spend a silly amount of money on? Where did I spend a disproportionate amount of my income? Where was I price insensitive? The answer was sports supplements. At the time, I was making less than 40K a year and spending 500 or more per month on supplements. It was insane, but dozens of my male friends were equally overboard. I already knew which ads got me to buy, which stores and websites I used to purchase goods, which bulletin boards I frequented, and all the rest. Could I create a product that would scratch my own itch? What was I currently cobbling together I had enough science background to be dangerous that I couldnt conveniently find at retail? The result was a cognitive enhancer called BrainQUICKEN. Before everyone got fired, I begged my coworkers to each prepay for a bottle, which gave me enough money to hire chemists, a regulatory consultant, and do a tiny manufacturing run. I was off to the races. 3What would I dohavebe if I had 10 million? Whats my real TMI? In 2004, I was doing better than ever financially, and BrainQUICKEN was distributed in perhaps a dozen countries. The problem? I was running on caffeine, working 15hour days, and constantly on the verge of meltdown. My girlfriend, who I expected to marry, left me due to the workaholism. Over the next 6 months of treading water and feeling trapped, I realized I had to restructure the business or shut it downit was literally killing me. This is when I began journaling on a few questions, including What would I want to do, have, and be if I had 10 million in the bank? and Whats my real target monthly income TMI? For the latter, in other words How much does my dream lifethe stuff Im deferring for retirementreally cost if I pay on a monthly basis? See fourhourworkweek.comtmi. After running the numbers, most of my fantasies were far more affordable than Id expected. Perhaps I didnt need to keep grinding and building? Perhaps I needed more time and mobility, not more income? This made me think that maybe, just maybe, I could afford to be happy and not just successful. I decided to take a long overseas trip. 4What are the worst things that could happen? Could I get back here? These questions, also from 2004, are perhaps the most important of all, so they get their own chapter. See fearsetting on page 463. 5If I could only work 2 hours per week on my business, what would I do? After removing anxieties about the trip with fearsetting, the next practical step was removing myself as the bottleneck in my business. Alas, how can I not be a bottleneck in my own business? isnt a good question. After reading The EMyth Revisited by Michael Gerber and The 8020 Principle by Richard Koch, I decided that extreme questions were the forcing function I needed. The question I found most helpful was, If I could only work 2 hours per week on my business, what would I do? Honestly speaking, it was more like, Yes, I know its impossible, but if you had a gun to your head or contracted some horrible disease, and you had to limit work to 2 hours per week, what would you do to keep things afloat? The 8020 principle, also known as Paretos law, is the primary tool in this case. It dictates that 80 or more of your desired outcomes are the result of 20 or less of your activities and inputs. Here are two related questions I personally used What 20 of customersproductsregions are producing 80 of the profit? What factors or shared characteristics might account for this? Many such questions later, I began making changes firing my highestmaintenance customers putting more than 90 of my retail customers on autopilot with simple terms and standardized order processes and deepening relationships and increasing order sizes with my 3 to 5 highestprofit, lowestheadache customers. That all led to . . . 6What if I let them make decisions up to 100? 500? 1,000? This question allowed me to take my customer service workload from 40 to 60 hours per week to less than 2 hours per week. Until mid2004, I was the sole decision maker.

Fastforward to December 26, 2006. Ive finished writing The 4Hour Workweek, and I sit down after a lovely Christmas to think about the upcoming April launch. What to do? I had no idea, so I tracked down roughly a dozen bestselling authors. I asked each questions like, What were the biggest wastes of time and money for your last book launch? What would you never do again? What would you do more of? If you had to choose one place to focus 10,000, where would you focus? I heard one word repeatedly blogs. They were apparently both very powerful and underappreciated. My first question was, What the hell is a blog? My next questions were How are people currently trying to reach bloggers? and Whats the least crowded channel? The people pitching bloggers were generally using email first and phone second. Even though those were my strengths, I decided to experiment with inperson meetings at conferences. Why? Because I felt my odds would be better as one out of five people in a lounge, rather than one email out of 500 emails in an overflowing inbox. I packed my bags and headed to Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show in January, which had more than 150,000 attendees in 2005. Its like the Super Bowl of technology releases, where all the geeks get to play with new toys. I never even walked in the front door. I parked myself at the offsite Seagatesponsored BlogHaus lounge, where bloggers were invited to relax, recharge their laptops, and drink free booze. I sipped alcohol, asked a lot of dumb questions, and never overtly pitched. I only mentioned the book if someone asked me why I was there answer I just finished my first book, and Im really nervous about the launch. Im here to learn more about blogs and technology. Famous tech blogger Robert Scoble later described my intricate marketing plan as get drunk with bloggers. It worked surprisingly well. 8What if I couldnt pitch my product directly? During the 2007 book launch, I quickly found that most media rightly dont give a rats ass about book launches. They care about stories, not announcements, so I asked myself, What if I couldnt pitch my product directly? What if I had to sell around the product? Well, I could showcase people from the book whove completely redesigned their lives human interest I could write about unrelated crazy experiments, but drive people to my bookfocused website Google Geek to Freak to see the result. It was my firstever viral blog post I could popularize a new term and aim for pop culture see lifestyle design on page 278 I could go meta and make the launch itself a news item I also did this with my video book trailer for The 4Hour Body, as well as the BitTorrent partnership for The 4Hour Chef. People dont like being sold products, but we all like being told stories. Work on the latter. 9What if I created my own realworld MBA? This kicked off in 2007 to 2008. See page 250 for full details. 10Do I need to make it back the way I lost it? In 2008, I owned a home in San Jose, California, and its value cratered. More accurately, the bank owned the home and I had an illconceived adjustablerate mortgage. On top of that, I was on the cusp of moving to San Francisco. To sell would have meant a 150,000 loss.

More accurately, the bank owned the home and I had an illconceived adjustablerate mortgage. On top of that, I was on the cusp of moving to San Francisco. To sell would have meant a 150,000 loss. Ultimately, I picked up and moved to San Francisco, regardless, leaving my San Jose home empty. For months, friends pressured me to rent it, emphasizing how I was flushing money down the toilet otherwise. I eventually buckled and followed their advice. Even with a property management company, regular headaches and paperwork ensued. Regret followed. One introspective night, I had some wine and asked myself Do I really need to make money back the same way Im losing it? If you lose 1,000 at the blackjack table, should you try and recoup it there? Probably not. If Im losing money via the mortgage payments on an empty house, do I really need to cover it by renting the house itself? No, I decided. I could much more easily create income elsewhere e.g., speaking gigs, consulting, etc. to put me in the black. Humans are very vulnerable to a cognitive bias called anchoring, whether in real estate, stocks, or otherwise. I am no exception. I made a study of this a lot of good investors like Think Twice by Michael Mauboussin, and shortly thereafter sold my San Jose house at a large loss. Once my attention and mind space was freed up, I quickly made it back elsewhere. 11What if I could only subtract to solve problems? From 2008 to 2009, I began to ask myself, What if I could only subtract to solve problems? when advising startups. Instead of answering, What should we do? I tried first to hone in on answering, What should we simplify? For instance, I always wanted to tighten the conversion fishing net the percentage of visitors who sign up or buy before driving a ton of traffic to one of my portfolio companies. One of the first dozen startups I worked with was named Gyminee. It was rebranded Daily Burn, and at the time, they didnt have enough manpower to do a complete redesign of the site. Adding new elements wouldve been timeconsuming, but removing them wasnt. As a test, we eliminated roughly 70 of the above the fold clickable elements on their homepage, focusing on the single most valuable click. Conversions immediately improved 21.1. That quickanddirty test informed later decisions for much more expensive development. The founders, Andy Smith and Stephen Blankenship, made a lot of great decisions, and the company was acquired by IAC in 2010. Ive since applied this What if I could only subtract . . . ? to my life in many areas, and I sometimes rephrase it as What should I put on my nottodo list? 12What might I put in place to allow me to go off the grid for 4 to 8 weeks, with no phone or email? Though wordy, I have asked variations of this question many times since 2004. It used to end with, . . . allow me to go on vacation for 4 to 8 weeks, but thats no longer enough. Given the spread of broadband, its extremely easy to take a vacation to Brazil or Japan and still work nonstop on your business via laptop. This kind of subtle selfdeception is a time bomb. For the last 5 years, Ive asked myself, in effect, What can I put in place so that I can go completely off the grid for 4 to 8 weeks? To entrepreneurs who are feeling burned out, this is also the question I pose most often. Two weeks isnt enough, as you can let fires erupt and then attempt to repair things when you return. Four to 8 weeks or more doesnt allow you to be a firefighter. It forces you to put systems and policies in place, ditch adhoc emailbased triage, empower other people with rules and tools, separate the critical few from the trivial many, and otherwise create a machine that doesnt require you behind the drivers wheel 247. Heres the most important point The systems far outlive the vacation, and when you come home, youll realize that youve taken your business and life to the next level. This is only possible if you work on your business instead of in your business, as Michael Gerber might say. 13Am I hunting antelope or field mice? I lifted this question around 2012 from former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich. I read about it in Buck Up, Suck Up . . . and Come Back When You Foul Up 12 Winning Secrets from the War Room, written by James Carville and Paul Begala, the political strategists behind Bill Clintons presidential campaign war room.

His strategic abilityhis relentless focus on capturing the House of Representatives for the Republicansled to one of the biggest political landslides in American history. Now that hes in the private sector, Newt uses a brilliant illustration to explain the need to focus on the big things and let the little stuff slide the analogy of the field mice and the antelope. A lion is fully capable of capturing, killing, and eating a field mouse. But it turns out that the energy required to do so exceeds the caloric content of the mouse itself. So a lion that spent its day hunting and eating field mice would slowly starve to death. A lion cant live on field mice. A lion needs antelope. Antelope are big animals. They take more speed and strength to capture and kill, and once killed, they provide a feast for the lion and her pride. A lion can live a long and happy life on a diet of antelope. The distinction is important. Are you spending all your time and exhausting all your energy catching field mice? In the short term it might give you a nice, rewarding feeling. But in the long run youre going to die. So ask yourself at the end of the day, Did I spend today chasing mice or hunting antelope? Another way I often approach this is to look at my todo list and ask Which one of these, if done, would render all the rest either easier or completely irrelevant? 14Could it be that everything is fine and complete as is? Since starting deep work with plant medicines in 2013 see James Fadiman, page 100, Ive doubled and tripled down on cultivating more daily appreciation and presentstate awareness. The above is one of the questions I ask myself. Its accompanied by complementary tools and rituals like the 5Minute Journal page 146, the Jar of Awesome page 570, and thinking of daily wins before bed la Peter Diamandis page 373. To reiterate what Ive said elsewhere in this book, typeA personalities have goal pursuit as default hardwiring. This is excellent for producing achievement, but also anxiety, as youre constantly futurefocused. Ive personally decided that achievement is no more than a passing grade in life. Its a C that gets you limping along to the next grade. For anything more, and certainly for anything approaching happiness, you have to want what you already have. 15What would this look like if it were easy? This question and the next both came about in 2015. These days, more than any other question, Im asking What would this look like if it were easy? If I feel stressed, stretched thin, or overwhelmed, its usually because Im overcomplicating something or failing to take the simpleeasy path because I feel I should be trying harder old habits die hard. 16How can I throw money at this problem? How can I waste money to improve the quality of my life? This is somewhat selfexplanatory. Dan Sullivan is the founder and president of a company called Strategic Coach that has saved the sanity of many serial entrepreneurs I know. One of Dans sayings is If youve got enough money to solve the problem, you dont have the problem. In the beginning of your career, you spend time to earn money. Once you hit your stride in any capacity, you should spend money to earn time, as the latter is nonrenewable. It can be hard to make and maintain this gear shift, so the above question is in my regular journaling rotation. 17No hurry, no pause. This isnt a questionits a fundamental reset. No hurry, no pause was introduced to me by Jenny SauerKlein jennysauerklein.com, who, along with Jason Nemer page 46, cocreated AcroYoga. The expression is one of the 9 Principles of Harmony from Breema, a form of bodywork she studied for many years. I routinely write No hurry, no pause at the top of my notebooks as a daily reminder. In effect, its shorthand for Derek Siverss story of the 45minute versus 43minute bike ride page 190you dont need to go through life huffing and puffing, straining and redfaced. You can get 95 of the results you want by calmly putting one foot in front of the other. One former Navy SEAL friend recently texted me a principle used in their training Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast. Perhaps Im just getting old, but my definition of luxury has changed over time. Now, its not about owning a lot of stuff. Luxury, to me, is feeling unrushed. No hurry, no pause. So, kids, those are my questions. May you find and create many of your own. Be sure to look for simple solutions. If the answer isnt simple, its probably not the right answer. In a blink of an eye, well all be gone. 100 years compared to infinity is nothing. I talk to my sister all the time. . . .

Smooth is fast. Perhaps Im just getting old, but my definition of luxury has changed over time. Now, its not about owning a lot of stuff. Luxury, to me, is feeling unrushed. No hurry, no pause. So, kids, those are my questions. May you find and create many of your own. Be sure to look for simple solutions. If the answer isnt simple, its probably not the right answer. In a blink of an eye, well all be gone. 100 years compared to infinity is nothing. I talk to my sister all the time. . . . I say, Girl, you better start having some fun. Were gonna be gone in a minute. Youre gonna look back and say, Shit, I should have been laughing, and now Im dead. Jamie Foxx Jamie Foxx TWIGSC iamjamiefoxx is an Academy Awardwinning actor, a Grammy Awardwinning musician, and a world famous standup and improv comedian. He is, without a doubt, the most consummate performer and entertainer I have ever met. In the 2 hours we spent together in his home studio, he blew my mind. PullUp Bars Are Everything Jamies morning workout routine, done roughly every other day, consists of 15 pullups, 50 pushups, 100 situps 15 pullups different grip, 50 pushups 10 pullups first grip 10 pullups second grip I kept wondering how Tyrin Turner, Caine in Menace II Society, was always in shape. He said Man, Im trying to tell you, the pullup bars are everything. This is similar in its simplicity to General Stan McChrystals workout, page 435. The First Day Eric Marlon Bishop Used the Name Jamie Foxx I ended up going to this Evening at the Improv, the Improv in Santa Monica. I had never been there. I noticed that 100 guys would show up, and 5 girls would show up. The 5 girls would always get on the show because they needed to break up the monotony. The producers would pick randomly from the list of people who showed up. So I said, Hmmm, I got something. I wrote down all of these unisex names on the list Stacy Green, Tracy Brown, Jamie Foxx . . . and the guy chooses from the list. He says, Jamie Foxx, is she here? Shell be first. I said, No, thats me. Oh, okay. All right, well, youre going up. Youre the fresh meat. They were shooting Evening at the Improv, this old comedy show back in the day. He said, Youll be the guy we just throw up to see if you get a laugh or two. Its gonna be a tough crowd. . . . People in the crowd are like, Whos the kid? Is he on the show? Oh, hes fresh meat. Hes an amateur. So then they started yelling my nameYo, Jamie! Hey, Jamie!but Im not used to the name. So now they think Im arrogant. This motherfucker . . . hes not even listening to us. . . . Whats on the Other Side of Fear? Nothing. Jamie is incredibly confident. As one of his close friends described to me Even when things go a little south, he ALWAYS makes you feel like he has everything under control. I see a lot of people in his circle gravitate toward him for that confidence, myself included. I asked Jamie how he teaches confidence to his children, and he said that he asks his daughters to explore their fears with the question, Whats on the other side of fear? His answer is always, Nothing. He elaborates People are nervous for no reason, because no ones gonna come out and slap you or beat you up. . . . When we talk about fear or a lack of being aggressive holding someone back, its in your head. Not everybody is going to be super aggressive, but the one thing that you can deal with is a persons fears. If you start early, if they are a shy person, they wont be as shy if you keep instilling those things. TF Look at whatever youre afraid of and ask, What is on the other side of fear, if I push through this? The answer is generally nothing. There are few or no negative consequences, or theyre temporary. This touches upon Francis Ford Coppolas lesson that well explore later Failure is not durable. When you raise your kids, youre the bow, theyre the arrow, and you just try to aim them in the best direction that you can, and hopefully your aim isnt too off. Thats what my grandmother did for me.

Its never been easier to be a creator, and its never been harder to stand out. Good isnt good enough. Learning to Speak Truth Im 10 years old, maybe. I think Im in the fifth grade, 1976, President Carter. The preacher started preaching about homosexuality. I dont know what it is. Hes saying God made Adam and Eve, God didnt make Adam and Steve. Its Southern, its Texas. My grandmother stood up and said, You stop that, and the whole church stopped. Whats that, Miss Talley? Now, her words, what she said next, was very interesting. Let me tell you something. Ive had this nursery school for 30 years, and I want to let all of you know that God makes sissies, too. The whole place went, What? She said, These little boys that Ive watched since they could walk, they play by different music, and you stop that because youre making it hard for them to navigate. Sits down. My grandmother raised those people at church. She taught the whole communitys children during the school year and then, during the summer, youd drop the kids off at my grandmothers house and just let her keep them. She was very powerful in that sense. Ed Sheeran Before He Became Famous A young man by the name of Ed Sheeran slept on this carpet he points at the floor, where we were recording for like 6 weeks, trying to get his music career going. He came over from London. He heard about a live show that I do in L.A. He said, I really want to do your live show, if its possible, because I have some music that I love. Im thinking, Do my live show? Its mostly black, you know what Im saying? Its music people, really hardcore music people. Theyre very finicky. People who have played for Stevie Wonder. I had Miranda Lambert one night. I had Babyface. I said, This is the real shit youre talking about. I dont care about London and the accent. You gotta really come with it. He said, I think Ill be okay. . . . So I take him to my live night, 800 people there. People are playing, black folks sweating and just getting it . . . they would tear American Idol up. All of a sudden, Ed Sheeran gets up with a ukulele, walks out onto the stage, and the brother next to me says, Yo, Foxx, who the fuck is this dude right here, with the red hair and shit and the fucking ukulele? I said, Man, his name is Ed Sheeran. Lets see what he does. Within 12 minutes, he got a standing ovation. Before You Search Far and Wide . . . Jamie played Ray Charles in the film Ray, for which he won an Academy Award. Before filming, the two of them played piano together As were playing, Im on cloud nine. Then he moves into some intricate stuff, like Thelonious Monk. I was like, Oh shit, I gotta catch up and I hit a wrong note. He stopped because his ears are very sensitive Now, why the hell would you do that? Why you hit the note like that? Thats the wrong note, man. Shit. I said, Im sorry, Mr. Charles, and he said, Let me tell you something, brother. The notes are right underneath your fingers, baby. You just gotta take the time out to play the right notes. Thats life. Spirit animal African lion Bryan Johnson Bryan Johnson TW bryanjohnson, bryanjohnson.co is an entrepreneur and investor.

Usually they would say something like, That is interesting . . . and I would open my pitch book and walk them through the industry. Here are the providers, here is what they do, here is how they do it, here is what I do. I am the same as everyone else, except with me, you get honesty and transparency and great customer support. So, I became this companys numberone sales person. I broke all their sales records following this really simple formula of just selling honesty and transparency in a broken industry. Is It an Itch or a Burn? I have a lot of conversations with people who want to start their own thing, and one of my favorite questions to ask is, Is this an itch, or is it burning? If it is just an itch, it is not sufficient. It gets to this point of how badly you really want it. For me, I burned the boats. There was no way I was going to get a job. Failure was never an option. I had to make this work. You Should Probably Not Do That Again One time as a kid, I wonderedif you filled a milk gallon jug full of gasoline and you lit it on fire, what would happen? So, I took the gasoline that was otherwise used for the lawnmower, and I filled up this carton, and I went out on the street and I lit it on fire. . . . As expected, it produced quite a flame. My moms green Taurus rolled around the corner, coming down the street and I thought, Oh, no . . . So, in haste, I kicked over the jug and the gasoline spills onto the street and into the gutter. Now it is rolling down the gutter and there are cars down the street. I am imagining cars blowing up. So, I walk over to the gutter and I stomp on the gasoline to put it out, and, of course, that splashes. Now, the lawn is on fire. It is getting worse and worse. Anyway, we put the fire out and then the only thing she says to me is, Bryan, you probably should not do that again, and I said, All right, that is fair. That is typical of my mom. Parenting AdviceHow Did You Think About It? So, we got on a fourwheeler 2 weeks agomy 11 and 9yearold and Iand I said, Okay, I am going to put your helmets on, I am going to give you a 2minute lesson on how to go forward and how to go backwards, how to brake. I am going to give you some lessonsdo not go into a ditch, do not go on a hillside that will turn you over, etc.but I am expecting you now to go out for 5 minutes and come back safely, and tell me how you did it. What were your thought processes? How did you stay safe? What were the risks you took? But I want you to do it, and I am not going with you. . . . They came back in one piece, and it was a good experience for them to tell me Okay, Dad, this is how we looked at the risk, this is how we thought we might potentially get into a problem. . . . They even ran into a tree going slowly . . . but they talked about it, which I thought was really helpful. The Shackleton Sniff Test Ernest Shackleton had a huge impact on Bryan as a child. He is remembered for the grit and how they actually overcame all the obstacles that came about during the expedition. He is hugely inspirational in my life, because I apply what I call the Shackleton sniff test to everything I do. . . . I contemplate If I go about on this endeavor, does it meet the threshold that Shackleton applied? Is this the most audacious endeavor I can possibly conceive of? What would Shackleton do? TF Joe De Sena page 38 goes through the same exercise using Shackleton as the litmus test. Thats his dude, too, as a mutual friend put it. What is something you believe that other people think is crazy? Our existence is programmable. Do you have any quotes you live your life by or think of often? Life is not waiting for the storm to pass, its learning how to dance in the rain adapted from Vivian Greene.

He is remembered for the grit and how they actually overcame all the obstacles that came about during the expedition. He is hugely inspirational in my life, because I apply what I call the Shackleton sniff test to everything I do. . . . I contemplate If I go about on this endeavor, does it meet the threshold that Shackleton applied? Is this the most audacious endeavor I can possibly conceive of? What would Shackleton do? TF Joe De Sena page 38 goes through the same exercise using Shackleton as the litmus test. Thats his dude, too, as a mutual friend put it. What is something you believe that other people think is crazy? Our existence is programmable. Do you have any quotes you live your life by or think of often? Life is not waiting for the storm to pass, its learning how to dance in the rain adapted from Vivian Greene. FiveMonkey Games This relates to learned helplessness, which is often outdated and reinforced by others who mean well At Braintree, one of the principles I consistently communicated was, Challenge all assumptions. The story that I accompanied that with was There are five monkeys in a room, and there is a basket of bananas at the top of a ladder. The monkeys, of course, want to climb the ladder to get the bananas, but every time one tries, they are all sprayed with cold water. After a few times of being sprayed by cold water, the monkeys learn to not climb up the ladder to get the bananas. . . . The experimenters then take one monkey out and put a new monkey in, and the new monkey sees a banana. He thinks, Hey, I am going to grab a banana, but when he tries to go up the ladder, the other monkeys grab him and pull him back. . . . The experimenters eventually systematically pull every monkey out, and now you have five new monkeys. Any time a new monkey comes in and tries to climb the ladder, they grab the monkey and pull it back, but none of the five have ever been sprayed by cold water. TF This brought to mind a story from Tara Brach page 555 that I think of often This is a story about a tiger named Mohini that was in captivity in a zoo, who was rescued from an animal sanctuary. Mohini had been confined to a 10by10foot cage with a concrete floor for 5 or 10 years. They finally released her into this big pasture With excitement and anticipation, they released Mohini into her new and expensive environment, but it was too late. The tiger immediately sought refuge in a corner of the compound, where she lived for the remainder of her life. She paced and paced in that corner until an area 10by10 feet was worn bare of grass. . . . Perhaps the biggest tragedy in our lives is that freedom is possible, yet we can pass our years trapped in the same old patterns. What past limitationsreal or perceivedare you carrying as baggage? Where in your life are you pacing in a 10by10foot patch of grass? Where are you afraid of getting sprayed with water, even though its never happened? Oftentimes, everything you want is a mere inch outside of your comfort zone. Test it.

I was unhappy with the life I was living when I went into this one poker club in New York City, heard the way that people spoke, saw the way they looked. I realized Okay, thats a movie Rounders. . . . I went to my wife, Amy, and my best friend, Dave, and made a plan to be able to continue to work but to write this script in the mornings. Amy cleared out a storage space under our apartment. Dave and I at the time had no contacts in the movie business. We met for 2 hours every single morning. I think we took Sundays off, but other than that we didnt miss a morning. We worked for 2 hours. He was bartending, and I was going to my job Brian had just finished law school by taking night classes and was in the record business.

On Morning Pages, Which Brian Introduced Me To Every morning, what I do is based on the Morning Pages by Julia Cameron in The Artists Way. Its three longhand pages where you just keep the pen moving for three pages, no matter what. No censoring, no rereading. Its the closest thing to magic Ive come across. If you really do it every day in a real disciplined practice, something happens to your subconscious that allows you to get to your most creative place. Id sayand I know youve had this experience with other things youve given peopleIve given that book to 100 people and said, Im telling you, you need to do this. . . . Of the 100 people Ive given it to, maybe ten of them have actually opened the book and done the exercises. Of those ten, seven have had books, movies, TV shows, and made out successful. Its incredible. That book changed my life, even though its very spiritual and Im an atheist. Book and podcast recommendations?

Some Practical Thoughts on Suicide In this chapter, Im going to talk about suicide, and why Im still on this planet. It might seem dark, but the objective is to give hope and tools to those who need them. Its a much larger number than you might imagine. I kept the following stories secret from my family, girlfriends, and closest friends for years. Recently, however, I had an experience that shook mewoke me upand I decided that it was time to share everything. So, despite the shame I might feel, the fear that is making my palms sweat as I type this, allow me to get started. Here we go . . . A TWIST OF FATE Could you please sign this for my brother? It would mean a lot to him. There were perhaps a dozen people around me asking questions, and one fan had politely waited his turn. The ask A simple signature. It was Friday night, around 7 p.m., and Id just finished a live recording of the TWiST podcast. There was electricity in the air. Jason Calacanis, the host and interviewer, knows how to put on a show. Hed hyped up the crowd and kept things rolling for more than 2 hours on stage, asking me every imaginable question. The venue had been packed to capacity. Now, more than 200 people were milling about, drinking wine or heading off for their weekends. A handful of attendees had gathered near the mics to chat with me. Anything in particular youd like me to say to him? To your brother? I asked this one gent, who was immaculately dressed in a suit. His name was Silas. He froze for a few seconds. I saw his eyes flutter. There was something unusual that I couldnt put a finger on. I decided to take the pressure off Im sure I can come up with something. Are you cool with that? Silas nodded. I wrote a few lines, added a smiley face, signed the book hed brought, and handed it back. He thanked me and backed out of the crowd. I waved and returned to chatting with the others. Roughly 30 minutes later, I had to run. My girlfriend had just landed at the airport, and I needed to meet her for dinner. I started walking toward the elevators. Excuse me, Tim? It was Silas. Hed been waiting for me. Can I talk to you for a second? Sure, I said, but walk with me. We meandered around tables and desks to the elevator vestibule, and I hit the Down button. As soon as Silas started his story, I forgot about the elevator. He apologized for not having an answer earlier. His younger brotherthe one I signed the book forhad recently committed suicide.

Mexican proverb There are some secrets we dont share because theyre embarrassing. Like that time I met Naval Ravikant page 546 by accidentally hitting on his girlfriend at a coffee shop? Oops. Or the time a celebrity panelist borrowed my laptop to project a boring corporate video, and a flicker of porn popped up la Fight Clubin front of a crowd of 400 people? Another good example. But then there are dark secrets. The things we tell no one. The shadows we keep covered for fear of unraveling our lives. For me, 1999 was full of shadows. So much so that I never wanted to revisit them. I hadnt talked about this traumatic period publicly until April 29, 2015, during a Reddit AMA Ask Me Anything. What follows is the sequence of my downward spiral. In hindsight, its incredible how trivial some of it seems. At the time, though, it was the perfect storm. I include wording like impossible situation, which was reflective of my thinking at the time, not objective reality. I still vividly recall these events, but any quotes are paraphrased. So, starting where it began . . . Its the beginning of my senior year at Princeton University. Im slated to graduate around June of 1999. Somewhere in the next six months, several things happen in the span of a few weeks. First, I fail to make it to final interviews for McKinsey consulting and Trilogy software, in addition to others. I have no idea what Im doing wrong, and I start losing confidence after winning in the game of academics for so long. Second, a longterm for a college kid, anyway girlfriend breaks up with me shortly thereafter. Not because of the job stuff, but because I became insecure during that period, wanted more time with her, and was massively disruptive to her varsity sports season. Whats wrong with me? Third, I have a fateful meeting with one of my thesis advisors in the East Asian Studies department. Having read a partial draft of my work, he presents a large stack of original research in Japanese for me to incorporate. I walk out with my head spinninghow am I going to finish this thesis which generally run 60100 pages or more before graduation? What am I going to do? Its important to note that at Princeton, the senior thesis is largely viewed as the pinnacle of your fouryear undergrad career. Thats reflected in its grading. The thesis is often worth around 25 of your entire departmental GPA. After the above, things unfolded as follows . . . I find a rescue option! In the course of language learning research for the thesis, Im introduced to a wonderful PhD who works at Berlitz International. Bernie was his name. We have a late dinner one night on Witherspoon Street in Princeton. He speaks multiple languages and is a nerd, just like me. One hour turns into two, which turns into three. At the end, he says, You know, its too bad youre graduating in a few months. I have a project that would be perfect for you, but its starting sooner.

Thats reflected in its grading. The thesis is often worth around 25 of your entire departmental GPA. After the above, things unfolded as follows . . . I find a rescue option! In the course of language learning research for the thesis, Im introduced to a wonderful PhD who works at Berlitz International. Bernie was his name. We have a late dinner one night on Witherspoon Street in Princeton. He speaks multiple languages and is a nerd, just like me. One hour turns into two, which turns into three. At the end, he says, You know, its too bad youre graduating in a few months. I have a project that would be perfect for you, but its starting sooner. This could be exactly the solution Im looking for! I chat with my parents about potentially taking a year off, beginning in the middle of my senior year. This would allow me time to finish and polish the thesis, while simultaneously testing jobs in the real world. It seems like a huge winwin, and my parents are supportive. The Princeton powers that be okay the idea, and I meet with the aforementioned thesis advisor to inform him of my decision. Instead of being happy that Im taking time to get the thesis right what I expected, he seems furious So youre just going to quit?! To cop out?! This better be the best thesis Ive ever seen in my life. In my stressedout state, I hear a series of thinly veiled threats and ultimatums in the exchange that follows . . . but no professor would actually do that, right? The meeting ends with a dismissive laugh and a curt Good luck. Im crushed and wander out in a daze. Once Ive regained my composure, my shock turns to anger. How could a thesis advisor threaten a student with a bad grade just because theyre taking time off? I knew my thesis wouldnt be the best thesis hed ever seen, so it was practically guaranteed to get a bad grade, even if I did a great job. This would be obvious to anyone, right? I meet with multiple people in the Princeton administration, and the response issimply putHe wouldnt do that. Im speechless. Am I being called a liar? Why would I lie? Whats my incentive? It seems like no one is willing to rock the boat with a senior or tenured professor. Im speechless and feel betrayed. Faculty politics matter more than I do. I leave my friends behind at school and move off campus to workremotely, it turns outfor Berlitz. Remote means I work at home by myself. This is a recipe for disaster. The work is rewarding, but I spend all of my nonwork timefrom when I wake to when I go to bedlooking at hundreds of pages of thesis notes and research spread out on my bedroom floor. Its an uncontainable mess. After 2 or 3 months of attempting to incorporate my advisors originallanguage Japanese research, the thesis is a disaster. Despite or perhaps because of staring at paper alone for 8 to 16 hours a day, its a Frankensteins monster of false starts, dead ends, and research that shouldnt be there in the first place. At least half is totally unusable. I am, without a doubt, in worse shape than when I left school. My friends are graduating, celebrating, and leaving Princeton behind. I am sitting in a condo off campus, trapped in an impossible situation. My thesis work is going nowhere, and even if it turns out spectacular, I have in my mind a vindictive advisor whos going to burn me. By burning me, hell destroy everything Ive sacrificed for since high school great grades in high school got me to Princeton, great grades in Princeton should get me to a dream job, etc. By burning me, hell make Princetons astronomical tuition wasted money, nothing more than a small fortune my family has pissed away. I start sleeping in until 2 or 3 p.m. I cant face the piles of unfinished work surrounding me. My coping mechanism is to cover myself in sheets, minimize time awake, and hope for a miracle. No miracle arrives. Then one afternoon, as Im wandering through a Barnes and Noble with no goal in particular, I chance upon a book about suicide. Its right there in front of me on a display table. Perhaps this is the miracle? I sit down and read the entire book, taking copious notes into a journal, including other books listed in the bibliography. For the first time in ages, Im excited about research. In a sea of uncertainty and hopeless situations, I feel like Ive found hope the final solution. I return to Princeton campus. This time, I go straight to Firestone Library to check out all of the suiciderelated books on my todo list. One particularly promisingsounding title is out, so I reserve it. Ill be next in line when it comes back. I wonder what poor bastard is reading it, and if theyll be able to return it. Its important to mention that, by this point, I was past deciding. The decision was obvious to me. Id somehow failed, painted myself into this ridiculous corner, wasted a fortune on a school that didnt care about me, so what would be the point of doing otherwise? To repeat these types of mistakes forever? To be a hopeless burden to myself and my family and friends? Fuck that. The world was better off without a loser who couldnt figure this basic shit out. What would I ever contribute? Nothing. So the decision was made, and I was in fullon planning mode. In this case, Im dangerously good at planning.

This meant a postcard was mailed to my parents, something along the lines of Good news! The suicide book you requested is now available at the library for pickup! Oops and thank fucking God. Im caught on the phone with my mom, totally unprepared. She nervously asks about the book, so I think fast and lie Oh, no need to worry about that. Sorry! One of my friends goes to Rutgers and didnt have access to Firestone, so I reserved it for him. Hes writing about depression and stuff. I am snapped out of my own delusion by a oneinamillion accident. It was only then that I realize something My death wouldnt just be about me. It would completely destroy the lives of those I cared about most. I imagine my mom, who had no part in creating my thesis mess, suffering until her dying day, blaming herself. The very next week, I decide to take the rest of my year off truly off to hell with the thesis and focus on physical and mental health. Thats how the entire sumo story of the 1999 Chinese Kickboxing Sanshou Championships came to be, if youve read The 4Hour Workweek. Months later, after focusing on my body instead of sitting around trapped in my head, things are much clearer. Everything seems more manageable. The hopeless situation seems like shitty luck but nothing permanent. I return to Princeton, turn in my nowfinished thesis to my stillsour advisor, get chewed up in my thesis defense, and I dont give a fuck. It wasnt the best thesis hed ever read, nor the best thing Id ever written, but I had moved on. Many thanks are due to a few people who helped me regain my confidence that final semester. None of them have heard this story, but Id like to give them credit here. Among others My parents and family of course, Professor Ed Zschau, Professor John McPhee, Sympoh dance troupe, and my friends at the amazing Terrace Food Club. I graduated with the class of 2000 and bid goodbye to Nassau Hall. I rarely go back, as you might imagine. Sidenote After graduating, I promised myself that I would never write anything longer than an email ever again. Pretty hilarious that I now write 500pluspage books, eh? Given the purported jump in suicidal gestures at Princeton and its close cousins e.g., Harvard appears to have 2x the national average for undergrad suicides, I hope the administration is taking things seriously. If nearly half of your student population reports feeling depressed, there might be systemic issues to fix. Left unfixed, youll have more dead kids on your hands. And, by the way, its not enough to wait for people to reach out, or to request that atrisk kids take a leave of absence off the clock of the university to dodge liability. Perhaps regularly reach out to the entire student body to catch people before they fall? It could be as simple as an email offering help, resources, or a sympathetic ear. OUT OF THE DARKNESS Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage . . . Lao Tzu First, allow me to give a retrospective analysis of my near obliteration. Then, Ill give you a bunch of tools and tricks that I still use for keeping the darkness at arms length. Also, some of you might also be thinking Thats it?! A Princeton student was at risk of getting a bad grade? Boofuckinhoo, man. Give me a break . . . But . . . thats the entire point. Its easy to blow things out of proportion, to get lost in the story you tell yourself, and to think that your entire life hinges on one thing youll barely remember 5 or 10 years later. That seemingly allimportant thing could be a bad grade, getting into college, a relationship, a divorce, getting fired, or a bunch of hecklers on the Internet. So, why didnt I kill myself?

Pretend youre killing time or testing different suicide hotlines for a directory youre compiling. Whatever works. Speaking personally, I want to see the gifts you have to offer the world. And speaking from personal experience, believe me This too shall pass, whatever it is. 2. I realized it would destroy other peoples lives. Killing yourself can spiritually kill other people. Your death is not perfectly isolated. It can destroy a lot, whether your family who will blame themselves, other loved ones, or simply the law enforcement officers or coroners who have to haul your death maskwearing carcass out of an apartment or the woods. The guaranteed outcome of suicide is NOT things improving for you or going blank, but creating a catastrophe for others. Even if your intention is to get revenge through suicide, the damage wont be limited to your targets. A friend once told me that killing yourself is like taking your pain, multiplying it by 10, and giving it to the ones who love you. I agree with this, but theres more to it. Beyond any loved ones, you could include neighbors, innocent bystanders exposed to your death, and peopleoften kidswho commit copycat suicides when they read about your demise. This is the reality, not the cureall fantasy, of suicide. If you think about killing yourself, imagine yourself wearing a suicide bombers vest of explosives and walking into a crowd of innocents. Thats effectively what it is. Even if you feel like no one loves you or cares about you, you are most likely loved, and youre most definitely lovable and worthy of love. 3. Theres no guarantee that killing yourself improves things! In a tragically comic way, this was a depressing realization I came to while considering blowing my head off or getting run over. Damnation! No guarantees. The afterlife could be 1,000 times worse than life at its most painful. No one knows. I personally believe that consciousness persists after physical death, and it dawned on me that I literally had zero evidence that my death would improve things. Its a terrible bet. At least here, in this life, we have known variables we can tweak and change. The unknown void could be Dantes Inferno on steroids. When we just want the pain to stop, its easy to forget this. You simply dont know whats behind door 3. In our desperation, we often just dont think it through. Its kind of like the murdersuicide joke by one of my favorite comics, Demetri Martin Someone who commits a murdersuicide is probably somebody who isnt thinking through the afterlife. Bam! Youre dead. Bam! Im dead. Oh shit . . . this is going to be awkward forever. 4. Tips from friends, related to 2 above. For some of my friends including high achievers youd never suspect, a nonsuicide vow is what made all the difference. Here is one friends description It only mattered when I made a vow to the one person in my life I knew I would never break it to a sibling. Its powerful when you do that. All of a sudden, this option that I sometimes played around in my mind, it was off the table. I would never break a vow to my brother, ever. After the vow and him accepting it, Ive had to approach life in a different way. There is no fantasy escape hatch. Im in it. In the end, making a vow to him is the greatest gift I could have given myself. As silly as it might sound, its sometimes easier to focus on keeping your word, and avoiding hurting someone, than preserving your own life. And thats totally okay. Use what works first, and you can fix the rest later. If you need to disguise a vow out of embarrassment How would I confess that to a friend?!, find a struggling friend and make a mutual nonsuicide vow. Make it seem like youre only trying to protect him or her. Still too much? Make it a mutual nonselfhurt vow with a friend who beats himself or herself up. Make it about them as much as you. If you dont care about yourself, make it about other people. PRACTICAL GREMLIN DEFENSE Now, lets talk daytoday tactics. The fact of the matter is this if youre driven, an entrepreneur, a typeA personality, or a hundred other things, mood swings are part of your genetic hardwiring. Its a blessing and a curse. Below are a number of habits and routines that help me. They might seem simplistic, but they keep me from careening too far off the tracks.

For me, this is 80 of the battle. When possible, I prefer an actual How can I help you, sir? gym to walking or a homebased workout, as the last thing I need is alone time with my head. Somehow force yourself to be around other humans. Each morning, express heartfelt gratitude to one person you care about, or whos helped or supported you. Text, message, write, or call. Cant think of anyone? Dont forget past teachers, classmates, coworkers from early in your career, old bosses, etc. If you cant seem to make yourself happy, do little things to make other people happy. This is a very effective magic trick. Focus on others instead of yourself. Buy coffee for the person behind you in line I do this a lot, compliment a stranger, volunteer at a soup kitchen, help a classroom on DonorsChoose.org, buy a round of drinks for the line cooks and servers at your favorite restaurant, etc. The little things have a big emotional payback, and guess what? Chances are, at least one person you make smile is on the front lines with you, quietly battling something nearly identical. TO WRAP UPON THE GREEN AND THE GRAY My perfect storm was nothing permanent. But, of course, its far from the last storm Ill face. There will be many more. The key is building fires where you can warm yourself as you wait for the tempest to pass. These firesthe routines, habits, relationships, and coping mechanisms you buildhelp you to look at the rain and see fertilizer instead of a flood. If you want the lushest green of life and you do, the gray is part of the natural cycle. You are not flawed. You are human. You have gifts to share with the world. And when the darkness comes, when you are fighting the demons, just remember Im right there fighting with you. You are not alone. Theres a large tribe around you, and thousands of them are reading this book. The gems Ive found were forged in the struggle. Never ever give up. Much love to you and yours, Tim Spirit animal Great white shark Robert Rodriguez Robert Rodriguez TW Rodriguez, elreynetwork.com is a director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer, editor, and musician. He is also the founder and chairman of El Rey Network, a new genrebusting cable network. There, he hosts one of my favorite interviewformat shows, The Directors Chair. While a student at the University of Texas at Austin, Rodriguez wrote the script for his first feature film while he was a paid subject in a clinical experiment at a drug research facility. That paycheck covered the cost of shooting. The film, El Mariachi, went on to win the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, and became the lowestbudget movie ever released by a major studio. Rodriguez went on to write, produce, and direct many successful films, including Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, the Spy Kids franchise, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Frank Millers Sin City, Machete, and others. Preface This is the motherlode. The stars and caffeine aligned to make this interview extremely rich, and Robert hit a home run. My personal highlight doc for this episode was a book by itself. So, please indulge me, as this one is longer than usual. Its worth it. Whats Your Own Rodriguez List? The term Rodriguez list has come to mean writing down all of your assets and building a film around the list. It originates from Roberts approach to making El Mariachi, which he shot as a test film for himself. This What assets might we have? question is also asked by billionaire Reid Hoffman page 228. Heres Roberts story I just took stock of what I had. My friend Carlos, hes got a ranch in Mexico. Okay, thatll be where the bad guy is. His cousin owns a bar. The bar is where theres going to be the first, initial shootout. Its where all the bad guys hang out. His other cousin owns a bus line.

His other friend had a turtle he found. Okay, the turtles in the movie because people will think we had an animal wrangler, and that will suddenly raise production value. I wrote everything around what we had, so you never had to go search, and you never had to spend anything on the movie. The movie cost, really, nothing. The only cost was really just that I wanted to shoot it on film instead of video, so that it would look more expensive, and try to tell people I made it for 70K and try to sell it for 70K. Robert spent 7K on El Mariachi. Instead, it ended up going to Columbia and getting released. When we won Sundance, the Audience Award, my acceptance speech said, Youre going to get a lot more entries next year. When people find out that this is the one that won, a movie made with no money and no crew, everyones going to pick up a camera and start making their own movies. Its been flooded with entries since then. It was a real change in the paradigm. The Benefits of Treating Things like a Test I didnt think anyone was going to see El Mariachi. It was really just a test film. Thats why I did it in Spanish. I did it for the Spanish market. . . . I figured Ill do two or three of these things, cut them all together, take out the best portions and use it on my demo reel, and then use the money that I make to go make a real first Englishlanguage, American, independent film. . . . I didnt overthink it at all. I would have treated it completely differently, had I thought I would ever even show it to anybody. Had I thought it would go to a festival and I would submit it, I would have spent ten times as much. I would have gone and borrowed money. Instead, everything was one take, even if it didnt work, because the films so expensive. And it was a noisy camera and a soundless camera. It would make so much noise, you couldnt record sound at the same time. So, I had to record sound the way youre doing right now. I would shoot a take, put the camera away, get the sound out, put the mic up close. . . . So I got great sound, but it was out of sync. But, you kind of talk in your own rhythm. So if I say, Hi, my name is Robert, you put the camera away, and now you do the audio Hi, my name is Robert, you can pretty much get it to sync. . . . If you look at Mariachi, its almost all in sync. . . . Where it started to get out of sync, I cut away to the dog, or I cut away to a closeup. It created this really snappy editing style, but it was really just to get it back in sync because I couldnt stand it. . . . Theres a freedom in limitations. Its almost more freeing to know Ive got to use only these items turtle, bar, ranch. Youre almost completely free within that. TF Excuses are a dime a dozen. In the case of entrepreneurship, the I dont have listI dont have funding, I dont have connections, etc.is a popular writeoff for inaction. But lack of resources is often one of the critical ingredients for greatness.

I talked to Michael Mann about this during The Directors Chair. We talked about Manhunter once, years ago. He didnt have money, hed fired the effects crew. Some of the really cool staccato editing was to cover up the fact that they didnt have effects, and I didnt know that. I always thought it was a stylistic choice. And he says, No, its because we didnt have any money or time. I had to almost cut it myself, and I was throwing ketchup on the guy between edits. It was like, Oh, my God, I thought that was a brilliant stylistic choice. I said, Im going to do that for all my movies now. I want all of them to not have enough money, not enough time, so that were forced to be more creative. Because thats going to give it some spark that you cant manufacture. People will tap into it or theyll go I dont know why I like this movie. Its kind of a weird movie, but theres something about it that makes me want to watch it again and again because its got a life to it. Sometimes art should be imperfect in a way.

Youre gonna stumble, but youre also gonna stumble upon an idea no one came up with. . . . That way, at least its a new frontier. I always found success by just going the opposite way. There was too much competition over there. If everyones trying to get through that one little door, youre in the wrong place. Sometimes at a film festival when people ask, How do we break in? I say, The problem is youre at a film festival. Nothing wrong with film festivals, but everyone else here is trying to get through that same door, and theyre not all going to fit. . . . So youve got to think bigger than that. Theres less competition up there. I always wanted to get into TV, but instead of going and competing with everyone else trying to get in on 7 p.m. on NBC on a Friday night, I decided to own a network. You know how many people are trying to own a network? Nobody. When that network I got, El Rey, was up for grabs, there were 100 other applicants. Now, that sounds like a lot. But out of the whole country, 100? Really? How many actually had a solid business plan and a vision of something that could be implemented? Probably 5. So youre competing with the top 5 instead of the top 20,000 trying to get in on NBC on Friday or Saturday night. So I always say Try to look bigger. . . . Failure Is Not Durable One of my favorite episodes of The Directors Chair is with Francis Ford Coppola The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, etc., and Robert refers later to this quote from Francis Failure is not necessarily durable. Remember that the things that they fire you for when you are young are the same things that they give lifetime achievement awards for when youre old. ROBERT Even if I didnt sell Mariachi, I would have learned so much by doing that project. That was the ideaIm there to learn. Im not there to win Im there to learn, because then Ill win, eventually. . . . Youve got to be able to look at your failures and know that theres a key to success in every failure. If you look through the ashes long enough, youll find something. Ill give you one. Quentin Tarantino asked me, Do you want to do one of these short films called Four Rooms where each director can create the film of their choosing, but it has to be limited to a single hotel room, and include New Years Eve and a bellhop? and my hand went up right away, instinctively. . . . The movie bombed. In the ashes of that failure, I can find at least two keys of success.

The movie bombed. In the ashes of that failure, I can find at least two keys of success. On the set when I was doing it, I had cast Antonio Banderas as the dad and had this cool little Mexican as his son. They looked really close together. Then I found the best actress I could find, this little halfAsian girl. She was amazing. I needed an Asian mom. I really wanted them to look like a family. Its New Years Eve, because it was dictated by the script, so theyre all dressed in tuxedos. I was looking at Antonio and his Asian wife and thinking, Wow, they look like this really cool, international spy couple. What if they were spies, and these two little kids, who can barely tie their shoes, didnt know they were spies? I thought of that on the set of Four Rooms. There are four of those Spy Kids movies now and a TV series coming. So thats one. The other one was, after Four Rooms failed, I thought, I still love short films. Anthologies never work. We shouldnt have had four stories it should have been three stories because thats probably three acts, and it should just be the same director instead of different directors because we didnt know what each person was doing. Im going to try it again. Why on earth would I try it again, if I knew they didnt work? Because you figured something out when youre doing it the first time, and the second attempt was Sin City. TIM Amazing. ROBERT So Spy Kids and Sin City came out of Four Rooms. If you have a positive attitude, you can look back. Thats why what Francis Ford Coppola is saying is correct. Failure isnt always durable. You can go back and you can look at it and go, Oh, that wasnt a failure. That was a key moment of my development that I needed to take, and I can trust my instinct. I really can. Setting the Precedent Be a Problem Early Robert has made all of his own movie posters since Desperado. Heres how he got there The creative agency shows up to shoot the movie poster. Antonio was sick that day, and they were like, Were here only one day so well put his outfit on one of the other crew members and well paste his head on later. Im thinking, Thats not going to look right. Nobody moves like him. Oh, geez, this is going to be awful. So we shot our own poster on the set, the famous one of him with the gun. I saw him doing that one day on the set, and I went and took a little snapshot that would be a great poster. When we went to show the studio the posters, the ones the other guys did looked like DVD covers. I put mine up there, too, and Lisa Henson, the president of Columbia, looked at all of them. She looked at the one that I had and said, We like that one, and I said, That ones mine. She looks at me like, Oh shit, had I known it was you, I probably wouldnt have said that. She goes, Really? Oh, we didnt know. Im glad I just put it up there along with the others and didnt say anything. Then that set a precedent. From then on, I could go to every studio and say, I do my own posters, too. So you guys can go ahead and try and make one, but well try and make one. The key is to do it early. Do it while youre still shooting. First impression is everything. Ill cut a trailer while Im still shooting and send it to a studio. Theyll try to make their own, over and over, and they cant get that first thing they saw out of their heads, Its still not as good as the one we saw. Notes at Midnight Robert takes copious notes. He sets an alarm for midnight every night to input the days notes into a Word document. He dates everything and stores them by year, so he can find whatever he might want later I have a little alarm that goes off at midnight, because around midnight is usually a good time, and Ill write something down. Because I found that even when I just wrote some items down, I could go back and fill them in later because I would remember. . . . What kept it going is when I would go back and review the journals and realize how many lifechanging things happened within a weekend. Things that you thought were spread out over 2 years were actually Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and that Monday. So many occurrences happened in chunks that could blow you away, things that kind of define you. . . . For anyone who is a parent, its a must.

Oh yeah, remember that time we went camping and I put the tent in the backyard and it had electricity going through? We had fans, and we were watching Jonny Quest and we were playing. . . . I must have a journal on that, and I must have video. So year by year, I just search camping. Oh, May 4, 1999. We went camping. Its on tape 25. I go find the tape and show it to them.

You Dont Need to Know. Trust Comes First. Robert has many different jobs and doesnt view creativity as jobspecific. Its a metaskill. He routinely plays guitar on set and invites master painters to set to teach the actors during breaks. He believes that if you develop creativity, trust and getting started often take care of the rest The technical part of any job is 10. 90 is creativity. If you already know how to be creative, youve kind of got the battle half beat, because you dont need to know. You dont need to know what note specifically youre going to play when you get on stage and do your solo. Everybody will ask, what did you just play? And youre going to go, I dont know. I asked Jimmie Vaughan How do you know what youre playing just now? I dont even know what I played. . . . Ask any of the greats. I studied under a painter, Sebastian Krger. I went all the way to Germany to watch him paint, to figure out his trick. How does he do it? Because I tried to do what he did, and it looked like garbage. He must have a special brush. He must have special paint and a special technique. So, I go and now, he starts with a mid tone, starts knocking in some highlights, a little bit on the chin, and then he goes to the eye. I ask, How do you know where to go next? He says, Oh, I never know. Its different every time. That drives me bonkers. What do you mean? How come I cant do that? and Id go sit down, and suddenly I could do it. It blows you away. So I take those lessons back and I teach my actors that. I teach my crew that. You dont need to know. TIM Sorry to pause, but this is so fascinating to me. So what clicked? What was the realization when you sat down and suddenly . . . ? ROBERT You get it in your own waythinking that you needed to know something, a trick or a process, before it would flow. If you got out of the way, it would just flow. What gives you permission to let it flow? Sometimes if you take 4 years of schooling or you study under somebody, then youve suddenly given yourself permission to let it flow. . . . Youre just opening up the pipe and the creativity flows through. And as soon as your ego gets in the way, and you go, I dont know if I know what to do next youve already put I in front of it and youve already blocked it a little bit. I did it once, but I dont know if I can do it again. It was never you. The best you can do is just to get out of the way so it comes through. When an actor comes to me and he says, Im not sure I know how to play this part, I say, Thats beautiful because the other halfs gonna show up when were there. They say knowings half the battle. I think the most important is the other partnot knowing whats going to happen but trusting that it will be there when you put the brush up to the canvas. Its going to know where to go.

I would sometimes not feel like facing the blank page, so I would go lie down and try and figure out if I could create this method, where I could stare at the ceiling and it will just appear, fully formed, and then I could go and draw it. I never could get that to work. Id be running out of time. Id run back to the table, and Id realize the only way to do it was by drawing. Youd have to draw and draw and draw. Then one drawing would be kind of funny or cool. That ones kind of neat. This one kind of goes with that. Then you draw a couple of fillerups and thats how it would be created. You had to actually move. I applied that to all my other work filmmaking and everything. Even if I didnt know what to do, I just had to begin. For a lot of people, thats the part that keeps them back the most. They think, Well, I dont have an idea, so I cant start. I know youll only get the idea once you start. Its this totally reverse thing. You have to act first before inspiration will hit. You dont wait for inspiration and then act, or youre never going to act, because youre never going to have the inspiration, not consistently. TF This is also how Kevin Kelly page 470 writes, and the sentiment reminds me of Rolf Potts page 362 The simple willingness to improvise is more vital, in the long run, than research. Even the Pros Dont Know On The Directors Chair, Robert Zemeckis said he thought he was making the worst movie ever in Forrest Gump . . . or that he was so punchy in Back to the Future that he almost cut the Johnny B. Goode sequence because he thought, Well, it doesnt really fit. Im going to cut it before we even preview it. TIM Thats when his editor was like, Just leave it in for the screening. ROBERT Lets just preview it. . . . He said, We couldnt peel people off the ceiling. You never know. It shows that you dont know. I want people to hear those stories because when you feel like, Oh, I dont know if Im doing it right. These other guys seem to know. No, they dont know. None of them know. Thats the beauty of it. You dont have to know. You just have to keep moving forward. More on Creativity When people say You do so many things. Youre a musician, youre a painter, youre a composer, youre a cinematographer, youre the editor. You do so many different things. I go, No, I only do one thing. I live a creative life. When you put creativity in everything, everything becomes available to you. . . . If Im going to get into this characters head, maybe Ill paint him first and see what he looks like visually, or musically figure out what he sounds like. You can work completely nonlinear that way. How you journal things, how you cross reference, how you present things, how you inspire your crew, how you inspire other people around you, how you inspire yourselfits all creative. And if you say youre not creative, look at how much youre missing out on just because youve told yourself that. I think creativity is one of the greatest gifts that were born with that some people dont cultivate, that they dont realize it could be applied to literally everything in their lives. His Pitch to Frank Miller to Get Rights for Sin City I went to Frank Miller, and I showed him this test I did for Sin City based on the graphic novels.

Funny Quote from His Kids Thats what my kids always say, Dads not cheating. Its just creative sportsmanship, when I beat them at a game because I bent some rule in my favor. Theyre entertained by that. They dont feel bad. They actually look forward to how Im going to bend the rules. Start with Why Roberts mostgifted book is Start with Why by Simon Sinek. I realized better what I was doing when I read that book, and I gave it to people to show them how to clarify what theyre doing right and what theyre doing wrong. Its a very simple approach that they should take every day. For instance if you go to an actor and say, Hey, Im a filmmaker and Im making a lowbudget movie, and I kind of need your name as a marquee to help sell it. I cant pay you very much, and its going to be probably a lot of work, but if you want to be in it . . . youre thinking about only yourself. And the answer will be No, get the hell out of here because all youre talking about is what you do and how you do it, which is I make lowbudget movies. Yeah, so what? It means youve got no money. Instead, I always start with a why. I go to them and say, I love what you do. Ive always been a big fan. Ive got a part that you would never get. I believe in creative freedom. I dont work with the studios. I work independently. Im the boss there. Its just me and my crew. Its very creative. Ask any of your actor friends. Theyll say Go have that experience. Youre just going to feel so invigorated. I shoot very quickly. Robert De Niro did Machete in 4 days. Im going to shoot you out in 4 days. Youll be on your next movie for 6 months. Youre on my movie for 4 days, and its going to be the most fun youve ever had, and youll probably get great reviews. Your performance is going to be really free, because Im going to give you that freedom. Thats why I do it. How do I do it? Well, I work very independently. I have very few people on my crew, we all do multiple jobs. We do it with less money, so that we have more freedom. What is it I do? Im an independent filmmaker. Do you want to come make this movie? Theyre like, Yes. Because its all about what they can do and how its going to fulfill them. You Never Have to Be Upset About Anything Robert recounted a conversation with his son, who was extremely upset I said, Im going to tell you a secret in life You never have to be upset about anything. Everything is for a purpose. You just failed your drivers test, and youre all pissed off. I couldnt be happier. Id rather you fail with a teacher and take it 100 more times than go fail in front of a cop, or make that same mistake and hit somebody. . . . I cant even think of a negative reason why you failing that test is a bad thing. Its really how you look at it, and the way you look at it is so important. If you can have a positive attitude, look at it, and say, Let me see, what I can learn from this? . . . Why would you ever get upset about anything? And he said, Wow. That makes so much sense. Youre upset because something didnt go according to plan? It might be for a good reason. Good by Jocko Willink, retired Navy SEAL Commander Full profile on page 412.

No. Accept reality, but focus on the solution. Take that issue, take that setback, take that problem, and turn it into something good. Go forward. And, if you are part of a team, that attitude will spread throughout. Finally, to close this up If you can say the word good, guess what? It means youre still alive. It means youre still breathing. And if youre still breathing, that means youve still got some fight left in you. So get up, dust off, reload, recalibrate, reengage, and go out on the attack.

During the writing of this book, I would sit in the sauna for 20 to 30 minutes late at night to decompress, then lie in the pool on my back, looking at the stars through the silhouetted branches of the trees. Under the light of a single bulb inside the barrel sauna, I would read something poetic to wind down my brain, such as Leaves of Grass or, as I began at one point on a recommendation, Zen in the Art of Archery by Eugen Herrigel. I had just started the practice of archery, and my routine was to take two or three breaks per day for 18 arrows each. I had textbooks and a coach on the practical side. Zen in the Art of Archery, on the other hand, appeared to be 80 nonsense riddletalk and 20 genius philosophical insight. But it provided a welcome break, a little mental stretching, and that was enough. One morning, my researcher, who Id brought from Canada to work on the book in person, stopped me at the refrigerator, where I was grabbing some food and cold water Youre so calm. How are you so calm when you have a million things flying around? I thought about it, and he was right. There was a lot up in the air. I was on the final sprint of my book deadline, there were perhaps a dozen unexpected business fires to manage, my dog had just been badly injured, our car had died, and I had various family members and houseguests coming and going. It was a threering circus, and I was the plate spinner. Historically, Id been an anxious, shortfused mess on book deadlines. I was extremely unpleasant to be around.

One morning, my researcher, who Id brought from Canada to work on the book in person, stopped me at the refrigerator, where I was grabbing some food and cold water Youre so calm. How are you so calm when you have a million things flying around? I thought about it, and he was right. There was a lot up in the air. I was on the final sprint of my book deadline, there were perhaps a dozen unexpected business fires to manage, my dog had just been badly injured, our car had died, and I had various family members and houseguests coming and going. It was a threering circus, and I was the plate spinner. Historically, Id been an anxious, shortfused mess on book deadlines. I was extremely unpleasant to be around. So what was different? I then realized and explained to him In the process of reading and rereading the lessons in this book, Id absorbed much more than Id realized. On autopilot, I was using good from Jocko, inviting Mara to tea like Tara Brach, looking at the stars as BJ Miller and Ed Cooke would, and putting fear in line, just as Caroline Paul did atop the Golden Gate Bridge. Im a list maker. Its how I keep my life in order, my world organized. What most surprised me about my calmness was that there was no list involved. Id simply tested one or two titan oneliners or tools in my head every day, andas Cal Fussman told methe good shit sticks. The things I needed at any given time kept coming to mind. The more I reread and pondered them, the more I saw the impact. Perhaps 16 hours after the refrigerator talk, I was totally spent and ready for a good sweat and cooldown. Solo, I headed out to the barrel sauna and sat down to breathe in the smell of cedar. The perspiration slowly poured out, like the days tension, and I reached the end of Zen in the Art of Archery. One passage, involving the parting comments of the Japanese master, caused me to stop for several minutes. Ive slightly abridged it here I must only warn you of one thing. You have become a different person in the course of these years. For this is what the art of archery means a profound and farreaching contest of the archer with himself. Perhaps you have hardly noticed it yet, but you will feel it very strongly when you meet your friends and acquaintances again in your own country things will no longer harmonize as before. You will see with other eyes and measure with other measures. It has happened to me too, and it happens to all who are touched by the spirit of this art. In farewell, and yet not in farewell, the Master handed me his best bow. When you shoot with this bow you will feel the spirit of the Master near you. . . . This made me smile. For the nerds among you, it made me think of the end of Return of the Jedi, after the Alliance defeats the Galactic Empire, when Luke Skywalker looks up into the night sky of Endor bear with me to see the shimmering and smiling spirit figures of ObiWan Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker. The first two were with him all along, and all three would be with him forever. It is my hope that when you read and reread this book, you will feel the spirit of these titans with you. No matter the hardship, challenge, or grand ambition before you, they are here. You are not alone, and you are better than you think. As Jocko would say Get after it. It makes a lot more sense if youve done psychedelics.

If you only had 2 to 5 minutes and they were willing to talk, how could you make the most of it? Below are questions Ive collected or concocted for just this hypothetical situation. Many of them are the rapidfire questions that I ask nearly every guest on The Tim Ferriss Show. A handful are adapted from questions I picked up from guests themselves such as Peter Thiel, page 232, and Marc Andreessen, page 170. When you think of the word successful, whos the first person who comes to mind and why? What is something you believe that other people think is insane? What is the book or books youve given most as a gift? What is your favorite documentary or movie? What purchase of 100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last 6 months? What are your morning rituals? What do the first 60 minutes of your day look like? What obsessions do you explore on the evenings or weekends? What topic would you speak about if you were asked to give a TED talk on something outside of your main area of expertise? What is the best or most worthwhile investment youve made? Could be an investment of money, time, energy, or other resource. How did you decide to make the investment? Do you have a quote you live your life by or think of often? What is the worst advice you see or hear being dispensed in your world? If you could have one gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it say? What advice would you give to your 20, 25, or 30yearold self? And please place where you were at the time, and what you were doing. How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Or, do you have a favorite failure of yours? What is something really weird or unsettling that happens to you on a regular basis? What have you changed your mind about in the last few years? Why? What do you believe is true, even though you cant prove it? Any ask or request for my audience? Last parting words? The MostGifted and Recommended Books of All Guests This is what youve been asking me for! A note on formatting Bolded books are mostgifted book answers. Bolded and underlined books are mostgifted book answers that did not appear in the podcast episode but that guests sent me afterward. Unbolded books were recommended or mentioned by the guest, but not specifically mostgifted. Which books came up the most?

Andreessen, Marc Right in the heart of San Francisco, it will be a billboard with just two words on it Raise prices. Attia, Peter This is water. la David Foster Wallace. And What would Richard Feynman Do? Bell, Mark I like some of the quotes we have in the gym, but one of my favorite quotes of all time is, Either youre in, or youre in the way. Belsky, Scott Its not about ideas, its about making ideas happen. Betts, Richard Love yourself. Birbiglia, Mike Id put it in Times Square and it would say, None of these companies care about you. Blumberg, Alex The first draft always sucks. Boone, Amelia Something along the lines of, No one owes you anything. I feel that theres such a level of entitlement now in people. That, I deserve this, or, I blah, blah, blah this. At the end of the day its hard work. Boreta, Justin Starve the ego, feed the soul. Brach, Tara LET YOUR HEART BE AS WIDE AS THE WORLD. Brewer, Travis I have a slogan that I live by Spreading positive energy through your movement. Brown, Bren I would put it in Washington, D.C. And it would say, Shut up and listen. But because her kids are not allowed to say shut up I would say Talk less, listen more. But in my heart, I would be saying Shut up. Callen, Bryan WHAT you think isnt as important as HOW you think. Carl, Shay Youre going to die someday, or maybe Id just have it say Youre going to die. And that seems gruesome, but my grandpa taught me thishe bought his coffin 5 years before he actually died. So when people would come over, he would take them down into the garage and show them his coffin. Chin, Jimmy Its funny because the two things that came into my mind immediately one was, Chill. The other one was, Get after it. They are diametrically opposed. Cooke, Ed Be thankful that you will never understand time. de Botton, Alain It would say, Life is only 400,000 hours long. Be kind. Or something like that. Just to grab the motorists as theyre speeding down the highway at insane speed. De Sena, Joe Spartan the Fuck Up. Diamandis, Peter The future is better than you think. Dubner, Stephen Watch the road! Eisen, Jonathan Save the microbes. Engle, Dan Be curious. Fadiman, James Awareness Cures. Foxx, Jamie It would be the billboard saying, Ball out, dog. Have a great time, go to church, love somebody, teach somebody, get angry a little bit. It would change. And the end of the last one would be, Have as much fun as you can. Because in the blink of an eye well all be gone. 100 years compared to infinity is nothing. My billboard would change constantly cause I think we all change. Fussell, Chris Life is a series of choicestake accountability for yours. Fussman, Cal Listen. Gazzaley, Adam All of life is a celebration of life. Gladwell, Malcolm Probably a picture of one of my favorite runners. Asbel Kiprop Godin, Seth Jay Levinson, another old friend who passed away recently, wrote Guerrilla Marketing, and he used to say the best billboard in history said, Free coffee next exit. Goldberg, Evan Accept each other. Goodman, Marc Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.Neale Donald Walsch. Hamilton, Laird Laugh more and have more fun. Harris, Sam Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice. Hof, Wim Breathe, motherfucker! Hoffman, Reid I would put the billboard in Washington, D.C. I would target congresspeople, and Id say, Have you worked with someone across the aisle today? Because what matters is not partisan conflict, but how we govern our country to actually have a better future. Holiday, Ryan And this too shall pass. John, Daymond Theres no reason why I could do it and you cant. Johnson, Bryan I would put it in New York and it would say, Do an anonymous and random act of kindness today.

MacAskill, Will It would be outside the Gates Foundation, or maybe outside Bill Gatess house . . . where ultimately, hes going to donate 100 billion.

Why wouldnt I think that? Because for a guy whos from a nonclassical background, from a nonmoney background, from a very small village in Englandno ones really done a great deal where Im fromand with one arm as well, and the age that I started, to then enter this arena of highbrow classical music and honing your craft to the highest level . . . I think by me doing that, I 100 think that anything is possible. Of course, hard work, determinationthose things go hand in hand. McChrystal, Stanley It would be in a high traffic area, probably an airport, a city like New York, or maybe on a street in a busy city, New York or Chicago or San Francisco. And it would have a simple quote from an individual named Robert Byrne. And it would say, The purpose of life is a life of purpose. McCullough, Michael Id probably do what you do, Tim, Pick something youre afraid of every day, and go after it, and Id put that on peoples way to work. McGonigal, Jane Play Tetris for 10 minutes within 24 hours of experiencing or witnessing something traumatic to prevent unwanted flashbacks and other symptoms of PTSD as demonstrated to work in multiple randomized controlled studies. Miller, BJ Dont believe everything you think. Neistat, Casey Be nice. Nemer, Jason Play! I feel like people are so serious. And it doesnt take much for people to drop back into the wisdom of a childlike playfulness. If I had to prescribe two things to improve health and happiness in the world, its movement and play, those two things. Because you cant really play without moving, so theyre kind of intertwined. Ohanian, Alexis Lives Remaining 0. Palmer, Amanda Radical empathy is our only hope Please pull over at the next rest stop and call someone you need to make peace with. Patrick, Rhonda Dont exercise to lose weight . . . do it to improve your brain. Paul, Caroline Caroline asked Tim for his answer. Tim said his answer would be Amelias, and Caroline changed hers to the same Well change itNobody owes you anything at all. Polanco, Martin Choose love. Poliquin, Charles Know yourself. Popova, Maria Kindness. Kindness. Kindness. Potts, Rolf Time is the truest form of wealth. Randall, Lisa Be curious and try to find solutions to problems. Ravikant, Naval Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want paraphrased from an old blog called Delusion Damage. Reece, Gabby Yielding to your fellow man is not getting taken advantage of. We are all in it together. Rodriguez, Robert One that I say a lot to people is, Dont follow the herd. Its easier when people can visually see it, but Im pointing in one direction. And I say that when you hear me talking about the network and the network sizzle. Ill say, If everyones going that wayto the leftwere going to go this way, to the right. Because thats how you stumble upon new things, by just going down the unbeaten path. Its always rewarding. In any way you choose, not just business but life in general and everything . . . you just go that way. And really cultivate your instincts.

But you must be strong first. von Ahn, Luis It would be in front of the Google Pittsburgh office and it would say Duolingo is hiring. Waitzkin, Joshua LIVE ALL IN. Weinstein, Eric Somehow, people have to learn that consensus is a huge problem. Theres no arithmetic consensus because it doesnt require a consensus. But there is a Washington consensus. There is a climate consensus. In general, consensus is how we bully people into pretending that theres nothing to seemove along, everyone. And so I think that in part, you should start to learn that people dont naturally come to high levels of agreement unless something is either absolutely clear, in which case consensus isnt present, or theres an implied threat of violence to livelihood or self. Willink, Jocko I guess my mantra is a very simple one, and thats Discipline equals freedom. Wilson, Rainn Maybe it would be a billboard that says Dont be an asshole. Because that would make the world a lot better place. Maybe someone driving along would be like, Oh, you know what? Maybe Im just gonna be not as much of an asshole today. Im not gonna cut people off on the road and ignore my kids, backstab someone at work.

Thank you for your time and generosity of spirit. May the good you share with the world be returned to you a hundredfold. Readers, please see the thankyou list in On the Shoulders of Giants page xi. To the inimitable Arnold Schwarzenegger, thank you for the wonderfully thoughtful Foreword. Speaking as a Long Island kid raised on Commando and Predator, its a dream come true to have you in these pages. To Daniel Ketchell and the rest of his ATeam, thank you for the great work you do, and for helping me get to know the Terminator. The more time I spend with Arnold and those around him, the more impressed I am. To Stephen Hanselman, my agent and friend, I told you to kick me in the head next time I wanted to do a definitive book. Good thing you forgot. Shall we get some jazz and whiskey now? To the entire team at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, especially the superhuman Stephanie Fletcher and the amazing design and production team Rebecca Springer, Emily Andrukaitis, Rachael DeShano, Jamie Selzer, Marina Padakis Lowry, Teresa Elsey, David Futato, Kelly Dubeau Smydra, Jill Lazer, Rachel Newborn, Brian Moore, Melissa Lotfy, and Becky SaikiaWilsonyou helped tame this beast and make it the ultimate playbook. Thank you for burning the midnight oil alongside me! To my publisher Bruce Nichols and his incredible team, including president Ellen Archer, my partner in crime Laurie Brown, Deb Brody, Lori Glazer, Stephanie Kim, Debbie Engel, and all members of the dedicated marketing and sales team, thank you for believing in this book and making magic happen. To Donna S. and Adam B., thank you for holding down the fort while I was offline! The podcast wouldnt exist, and I wouldnt be able to do any of it, without you. Donna, sorry for Mollys terrorizing of Hank. Ill pay for the therapy. Adam, next time Im at altitude, please knock the wine glass out of my hand. To Hristo Vassilev and Jordan Thibodeau, many thanks for the research, doublechecking of details, and endless support. Hristo, would you like a few hundred more Mediterranean wraps? Or calamari, perhaps? And dont forget those 20 minutes of sun in the morning. . . . To Amelia, you are the warrior princess of redlining. Words cannot express how much your help and support meant to me. Through all the SodaStreams and lost arrows, you never wavered. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Payment in nut butters and ice cream is in process. To Kamal Ravikant, your proofreading laughs were muchneeded medicine, and your suggested edits were muchneeded feedback. Thank you for being a companion on the path. Id be remiss to leave out the kind folks who spent many hours educating me on the details, tech, and craft of podcasting in the beginning. Many thanks, gentlemen! Listed in alphabetical order by first name and if I forgot anyone, please let me know Jason DeFillippo of Grumpy Old Geeks John Lee Dumas of Entrepreneur on Fire Jordan Harbinger of The Art of Charm Lewis Howes of The School of Greatness Matt Lieber and Alex Blumberg of Gimlet Media Pat Flynn of Smart Passive Income and Rob Walch of Libsyn Last but not least, this book is dedicated to my parents, who have guided, encouraged, loved, and consoled me through it all.

Later, later, later, and then, one moment, I sayjust not to lose face in front of myselfIm going to sit, and Im going to write for half an hour. And I do. Of course, this half an hour becomes 10 hours in a row. Thats why I write my books very quickly, because I cannot stop. . . . But I cannot stop procrastinating. Probably, this is my inner ritual. I have to feel guilty about not writing for 3 hours or 4 hours. Then, when Im there, I start writing and its nonstop. . . . A successful writing day is a day that I suffer in the morning, and I have fun in the evening, fun by writing. I should not describe this as fun. Its also painful . . . Im in a kind of trance. When I go to bed after 10 hours of working, well, the adrenaline is still circulating in my blood. It takes hours to sleep. There is this notepad by my side, and I take notes, but I take notes only to take them out from my head. They will be useless the next day. I never use notes that I take . . . and this has happened since I wrote my first book, The Pilgrimage. I cannot change this process. I wish I could sit and write and not feel guilty for 4 or 5 hours during the day. It is impossible. TF Even the best in the world struggle. I need to relearn this lesson often. For most writers who didnt start off as journalists e.g., Malcolm Gladwell, Neil Strauss, writing is hard and continues to be hard. What makes it easier? Knowing that many of the greats are going through the same thing. Its reassuring to know that someone at the top of their gamewho has seemingly beaten all of the oddsstill has the daily struggle. What are the most common mistakes or weaknesses of firsttime novelists? Keep it simple. Trust your reader. He or she has a lot of imagination. Dont try to describe things. Give a hint, and they will fulfill this hint with their own imagination. Thats why I am so reluctant to sell the rights of my books for movies because there, you have everything. The viewer does not need to think. However, if I say like in Aleph, at the very beginning, I am in my house in the Pyrenees, and there is an oak there. I dont need to explain my house in the Pyrenees. I only needed to put in the elements that are important the oak, myself, and the person that Im talking to. Thats all. . . . Trust your reader. Understand that he or she can fill the empty spaces. Dont overexplain. How do you capture ideas that might help your writing? I strongly encourage writers not to think about writing every time they do something. Forget notebooks. Forget taking notes. Let what is important remain. Whats not important goes away. When you sit down to write, there is this process of purging, this process of cleansing, where only the important things remain. Its much easier than taking notes and overloading yourself with information. What do you find helpful when you are stuck or stagnated? There is only one thing. When I feel stagnated, I promise myself that even if I dont feel inspired, I need to move forward. I need to have discipline. . . . In the middle of a book, there I am I dont know how to continue the story, even if its a nonfiction story. But then, I say, You, book, are fighting with me. Okay. Im going to sit here, and Im not going to leave you alone until I find my way out of this crossroads. It may take 10 minutes. It may take 10 hours. But if you dont have enough discipline, you dont move forward. . . .
