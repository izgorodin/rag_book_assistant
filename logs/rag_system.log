Query terms are weighted based on their part of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives have higher weights).\n\n    Guidelines for creating an optimized query:\n    1. Identify and include key concepts from the original query.\n    2. Use relevant entities, key phrases, and dates from the metadata if applicable.\n    3. Expand on important terms using synonyms or related concepts.\n    4. Consider the intent of the query (e.g., question, search, summarize).\n    5. Include terms that would work well with both keyword matching (BM25) and semantic search.\n    6. Prioritize nouns, verbs, and adjectives as they get higher weights in our system.\n    7.

Chunk 1 (relevance: 0.85):
It refers to Mr. Hews statement that Mr. Copp testified that Ford engaged in costbenefit analyses and that there was plenty of documentation for it. Ford argues that the documentation referred to by Mr. Coppthe GrushSaunby Reportwas excluded from evidence so that the statement was improper. However, there was other documentation which illustrated the fact that cost considerations caused Ford to delay incorporating safety features in the fuel tank system of its cars despite the knowledge that there was a need for such improvements. Furthermore, Mr. Copp was permitted to testify that Ford did in fact engage in costbenefit analyses which balanced life and limb against corporate savings and profits. Ford assigns a number of other remarks by Grimshaws counsel as misstatements of the evidence or exaggerations or mischaracterization of testimony. No useful purpose would be served by detailing them. We have examined the record and find that in each of the instances of which Ford complains, the argument was within the bounds of propriety. More importantly, having failed to object below, it was incumbent upon Ford to demonstrate that the claimed improprieties were such that a prompt objection and admonition to the jury would not have corrected the error. Ford has utterly failed to show that in any of the specific instances of claimed misconduct, an objection and admonition would not have remedied the situation. IV Instructions Ford complains of instructional errors on design defect and superseding cause. 119 Cal. App. 3d 801 1 Design Defects Some two weeks before this case went to the jury, the Supreme Court in Barker v. Lull Engineering Co. 1978 20 Cal. 3d 413 143 Cal. Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443, 96 A.L.R.3d 1, formulated the following twopronged definition of design defect, embodying the consumer expectation standard and riskbenefit test First, a product

portions of his body. Because Ford does not contest the amount of compensatory damages awarded to Grimshaw and the Grays, no purpose would be served by further description of the injuries suffered by Grimshaw or the damages sustained by the Grays. Design of the Pinto Fuel System In 1968, Ford began designing a new subcompact automobile which ultimately became the Pinto. Mr. Iacocca, then a Ford vice president, conceived the project and was its moving force. Fords objective was to build a car at or below 2,000 pounds to sell for no more than 2,000. Ordinarily marketing surveys and preliminary engineering studies precede the styling of a new automobile line. Pinto, however, was a rush project, so that styling preceded engineering and dictated engineering design to a greater degree than usual. Among the engineering decisions dictated by styling was the placement of the fuel tank. It was then the preferred practice in Europe and Japan to locate the gas tank over the rear axle in subcompacts because a small vehicle has less crush space between the rear axle and the bumper than larger cars. The Pintos styling, however, required the tank to be placed behind the rear axle leaving only 9 or 10 inches of crush spacefar less than in any other American automobile or Ford overseas subcompact. In addition, the Pinto was designed so that its bumper was little more than a chrome strip, less substantial than the bumper of any other American car produced then or later. The Pintos rear structure also lacked reinforcing members known as hat sections two longitudinal side members and horizontal crossmembers running between them such as were found in cars of larger unitized construction and in all automobiles produced by Fords overseas operations. The absence of the reinforcing members rendered the Pinto less

Chunk 3 (relevance: 0.76):
Fords management was reprehensible in the extreme. It exhibited a conscious and callous disregard of public safety in order to maximize corporate profits. Fords selfevaluation of its conduct is based on a review of the evidence most favorable to it instead of on the basis of the evidence most favorable to the judgment. Unlike malicious conduct directed 119 Cal. App. 3d 820 toward a single specific individual, Fords tortious conduct endangered the lives of thousands of Pinto purchasers. Weighed against the factor of reprehensibility, the punitive damage award as reduced by the trial judge was not excessive. Nor was the reduced award excessive taking into account defendants wealth and the size of the compensatory award. Fords net worth was 7.7 billion and its income after taxes for 1976 was over 983 million. The punitive award was approximately .005 percent of Fords net worth and approximately .03 percent of its 1976 net income. The ratio of the punitive damages to compensatory damages was approximately 1.4 to 1. Significantly, Ford does not quarrel with the amount of the compensatory award to Grimshaw. Nor was the size of the award excessive in light of its deterrent purpose. An award which is so small that it can be simply written off as a part of the cost of doing business would have no deterrent effect. An award which affects the companys pricing of its product and thereby affects its competitive advantage would serve as a deterrent. SeeNeal v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, supra, 21 Cal. 3d 910, 929, fn. 14. The award in question was far from excessive as a deterrent against future wrongful conduct by Ford and others. Ford complains that the punitive award is far greater than the maximum penalty that may be imposed under California or federal law prohibiting the sale of

Chunk 4 (relevance: 0.76):
In the case at bench, Ford failed to object to any of the matters of which it now complains during plaintiffs arguments to the jury. During Mr. Hews closing argument on behalf of plaintiff Grimshaw, which covers 100 pages of the reporters transcript, Ford did not interpose a single objection. Nor did Ford make any objection during Mr. Rabins closing argument on behalf of the Grays. During a recess Ford moved for a mistrial complaining of two matters to which Mr. Hews had referred during his argument His reference to Fords knowledge that death would result from defective and negligent design of the Pinto and his reference to a document prepared by Mr. Copp purporting to depict the crush area of the Pinto. The court denied the motion, noting that the reference to the document prepared by Mr. Copp but which had not been received in evidence was innocuous and that the reference to deaths as well as injuries was proper under the evidence. Significantly Ford does not now complain of the courts rulings in connection with its motion for a mistrial. Following Mr. Cox argument on behalf of Ford, Mr. Robinson made the rebuttal argument for plaintiff Grimshaw. Ford made two objections to Robinsons argument. Ford does not assign either of these two remarks by Mr. Robinson as error or misconduct on this appeal. Thus, none of the matters of which Ford now complains were matters to which an objection was interposed and a request for admonition made in the court below. Ford is, therefore, precluded from raising the contentions of misconduct unless they were such as could not have been cured by an admonition. 18 In assessing whether alleged misconduct could have been cured by admonition, a reviewing court must bear in mind the wide latitude accorded counsel

design, the hazard created by the protrusions on the differential housing, and, in addition, they served as evidence of Fords awareness of those defects. Exhibits Nos. 95 and 122 were properly received in evidence. 3 Exhibit No. 82 Ford contends admission into evidence over its objection of a report known as the Chiara memorandum plaintiffs exhibit No. 82 was error. The report, dated February 1971, was a Ford engineering study of the costs of a proposal for a fuel tank over the axle and a tank within a tank for a FordMercury automobile. Ford argues that the study was irrelevant because it pertained to an entirely different car to be built four years later. Mr. Copp testified, however, that the information in the study could be applied equally to the Pinto. The study showed that the cost of placing the gas tank over the axle with protective shield was about 10 and that a tank within a tank with polyurethane foam between tanks would have cost about 5. Whether the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice was a matter for the trial judge. Evid. Code, 352 e.g., Cramer v. Morrison supra, 88 Cal.

If specific information is not available, explain what is known and what is missing.\n\nContext:\nChunk 1 (relevance: 0.85):\nIt refers to Mr. Hews statement that Mr. Copp testified that Ford engaged in costbenefit analyses and that there was plenty of documentation for it. Ford argues that the documentation referred to by Mr. Coppthe GrushSaunby Reportwas excluded from evidence so that the statement was improper. However, there was other documentation which illustrated the fact that cost considerations caused Ford to delay incorporating safety features in the fuel tank system of its cars despite the knowledge that there was a need for such improvements. Furthermore, Mr. Copp was permitted to testify that Ford did in fact engage in costbenefit analyses which balanced life and limb against corporate savings and profits. Ford assigns a number of other remarks by Grimshaws counsel as misstatements of the evidence or exaggerations or mischaracterization of testimony. No useful purpose would be served by detailing them. We have examined the record and find that in each of the instances of which Ford complains, the argument was within the bounds of propriety. More importantly, having failed to object below, it was incumbent upon Ford to demonstrate that the claimed improprieties were such that a prompt objection and admonition to the jury would not have corrected the error. Ford has utterly failed to show that in any of the specific instances of claimed misconduct, an objection and admonition would not have remedied the situation. IV Instructions Ford complains of instructional errors on design defect and superseding cause. 119 Cal. App. 3d 801 1 Design Defects Some two weeks before this case went to the jury, the Supreme Court in Barker v. Lull Engineering Co. 1978 20 Cal. 3d 413 143 Cal. Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443, 96 A.L.R.3d 1, formulated the following twopronged definition of design defect, embodying the consumer expectation standard and riskbenefit test First, a product\n\nChunk 2 (relevance: 0.84):\nportions of his body. Because Ford does not contest the amount of compensatory damages awarded to Grimshaw and the Grays, no purpose would be served by further description of the injuries suffered by Grimshaw or the damages sustained by the Grays. Design of the Pinto Fuel System In 1968, Ford began designing a new subcompact automobile which ultimately became the Pinto. Mr. Iacocca, then a Ford vice president, conceived the project and was its moving force. Fords objective was to build a car at or below 2,000 pounds to sell for no more than 2,000. Ordinarily marketing surveys and preliminary engineering studies precede the styling of a new automobile line. Pinto, however, was a rush project, so that styling preceded engineering and dictated engineering design to a greater degree than usual. Among the engineering decisions dictated by styling was the placement of the fuel tank. It was then the preferred practice in Europe and Japan to locate the gas tank over the rear axle in subcompacts because a small vehicle has less crush space between the rear axle and the bumper than larger cars. The Pintos styling, however, required the tank to be placed behind the rear axle leaving only 9 or 10 inches of crush spacefar less than in any other American automobile or Ford overseas subcompact. In addition, the Pinto was designed so that its bumper was little more than a chrome strip, less substantial than the bumper of any other American car produced then or later. The Pintos rear structure also lacked reinforcing members known as hat sections two longitudinal side members and horizontal crossmembers running between them such as were found in cars of larger unitized construction and in all automobiles produced by Fords overseas operations. The absence of the reinforcing members rendered the Pinto less\n\nChunk 3 (relevance: 0.76):\nFords management was reprehensible in the extreme. It exhibited a conscious and callous disregard of public safety in order to maximize corporate profits. Fords selfevaluation of its conduct is based on a review of the evidence most favorable to it instead of on the basis of the evidence most favorable to the judgment. Unlike malicious conduct directed 119 Cal. App. 3d 820 toward a single specific individual, Fords tortious conduct endangered the lives of thousands of Pinto purchasers. Weighed against the factor of reprehensibility, the punitive damage award as reduced by the trial judge was not excessive. Nor was the reduced award excessive taking into account defendants wealth and the size of the compensatory award. Fords net worth was 7.7 billion and its income after taxes for 1976 was over 983 million. The punitive award was approximately .005 percent of Fords net worth and approximately .03 percent of its 1976 net income. The ratio of the punitive damages to compensatory damages was approximately 1.4 to 1. Significantly, Ford does not quarrel with the amount of the compensatory award to Grimshaw.

Chunk 1 (relevance: 0.83):
It refers to Mr. Hews statement that Mr. Copp testified that Ford engaged in costbenefit analyses and that there was plenty of documentation for it. Ford argues that the documentation referred to by Mr. Coppthe GrushSaunby Reportwas excluded from evidence so that the statement was improper. However, there was other documentation which illustrated the fact that cost considerations caused Ford to delay incorporating safety features in the fuel tank system of its cars despite the knowledge that there was a need for such improvements. Furthermore, Mr. Copp was permitted to testify that Ford did in fact engage in costbenefit analyses which balanced life and limb against corporate savings and profits. Ford assigns a number of other remarks by Grimshaws counsel as misstatements of the evidence or exaggerations or mischaracterization of testimony. No useful purpose would be served by detailing them. We have examined the record and find that in each of the instances of which Ford complains, the argument was within the bounds of propriety. More importantly, having failed to object below, it was incumbent upon Ford to demonstrate that the claimed improprieties were such that a prompt objection and admonition to the jury would not have corrected the error. Ford has utterly failed to show that in any of the specific instances of claimed misconduct, an objection and admonition would not have remedied the situation. IV Instructions Ford complains of instructional errors on design defect and superseding cause. 119 Cal. App. 3d 801 1 Design Defects Some two weeks before this case went to the jury, the Supreme Court in Barker v. Lull Engineering Co. 1978 20 Cal. 3d 413 143 Cal. Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443, 96 A.L.R.3d 1, formulated the following twopronged definition of design defect, embodying the consumer expectation standard and riskbenefit test First, a product

Chunk 2 (relevance: 0.79):
In the case at bench, Ford failed to object to any of the matters of which it now complains during plaintiffs arguments to the jury. During Mr. Hews closing argument on behalf of plaintiff Grimshaw, which covers 100 pages of the reporters transcript, Ford did not interpose a single objection. Nor did Ford make any objection during Mr. Rabins closing argument on behalf of the Grays. During a recess Ford moved for a mistrial complaining of two matters to which Mr. Hews had referred during his argument His reference to Fords knowledge that death would result from defective and negligent design of the Pinto and his reference to a document prepared by Mr. Copp purporting to depict the crush area of the Pinto. The court denied the motion, noting that the reference to the document prepared by Mr. Copp but which had not been received in evidence was innocuous and that the reference to deaths as well as injuries was proper under the evidence. Significantly Ford does not now complain of the courts rulings in connection with its motion for a mistrial. Following Mr. Cox argument on behalf of Ford, Mr. Robinson made the rebuttal argument for plaintiff Grimshaw. Ford made two objections to Robinsons argument. Ford does not assign either of these two remarks by Mr. Robinson as error or misconduct on this appeal. Thus, none of the matters of which Ford now complains were matters to which an objection was interposed and a request for admonition made in the court below. Ford is, therefore, precluded from raising the contentions of misconduct unless they were such as could not have been cured by an admonition. 18 In assessing whether alleged misconduct could have been cured by admonition, a reviewing court must bear in mind the wide latitude accorded counsel

Chunk 3 (relevance: 0.77):
his guardian ad litem and the Grays sued Ford and others. Grimshaw was permitted to amend his complaint to seek punitive damages but the Grays motion to amend their complaint for a like purpose was denied. The cases were thereafter consolidated for trial. fn. 3 Grimshaws case was submitted to the jury on theories of negligence and strict liability the Grays case went to the jury only on the strict liability theory. Fords Appeal Ford seeks reversal of the judgment as a whole on the following grounds 1 Erroneous rulings relating to Mr. Copps testimony 2 other erroneous evidentiary rulings 3 prejudicial misconduct by plaintiffs counsel 4 instructional errors and 5 jury misconduct. On the issue of punitive damages, Ford contends that its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted because the punitive award was statutorily unauthorized and constitutionally invalid and on the further ground that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of malice or corporate responsibility for malice. Ford also seeks reversal of the punitive award for claimed instructional errors on malice and proof of malice as well as on the numerous grounds addressed to the judgment as a whole. Finally, Ford maintains that even if punitive damages were appropriate in this case, the amount of the award was so excessive as to require a new trial or further remittitur of the award. In the ensuing analysis ad nauseam of Fords wideranging assault on the judgment, we have concluded that Ford has failed to demonstrate that any errors or irregularities occurred during the trial which resulted in a miscarriage of justice requiring reversal. I The Testimony of Harley Copp Mr. Harley Copp, a former Ford engineering executive, was plaintiffs principal witness on the subject of defects in the design, placement, and protection of the

Chunk 4 (relevance: 0.75):
Fords management was reprehensible in the extreme. It exhibited a conscious and callous disregard of public safety in order to maximize corporate profits. Fords selfevaluation of its conduct is based on a review of the evidence most favorable to it instead of on the basis of the evidence most favorable to the judgment. Unlike malicious conduct directed 119 Cal. App. 3d 820 toward a single specific individual, Fords tortious conduct endangered the lives of thousands of Pinto purchasers.

Nor was the reduced award excessive taking into account defendants wealth and the size of the compensatory award. Fords net worth was 7.7 billion and its income after taxes for 1976 was over 983 million. The punitive award was approximately .005 percent of Fords net worth and approximately .03 percent of its 1976 net income. The ratio of the punitive damages to compensatory damages was approximately 1.4 to 1. Significantly, Ford does not quarrel with the amount of the compensatory award to Grimshaw. Nor was the size of the award excessive in light of its deterrent purpose. An award which is so small that it can be simply written off as a part of the cost of doing business would have no deterrent effect. An award which affects the companys pricing of its product and thereby affects its competitive advantage would serve as a deterrent. SeeNeal v. Farmers Ins.

If specific information is not available, explain what is known and what is missing.\n\nContext:\nChunk 1 (relevance: 0.83):\nIt refers to Mr. Hews statement that Mr. Copp testified that Ford engaged in costbenefit analyses and that there was plenty of documentation for it. Ford argues that the documentation referred to by Mr. Coppthe GrushSaunby Reportwas excluded from evidence so that the statement was improper. However, there was other documentation which illustrated the fact that cost considerations caused Ford to delay incorporating safety features in the fuel tank system of its cars despite the knowledge that there was a need for such improvements. Furthermore, Mr. Copp was permitted to testify that Ford did in fact engage in costbenefit analyses which balanced life and limb against corporate savings and profits. Ford assigns a number of other remarks by Grimshaws counsel as misstatements of the evidence or exaggerations or mischaracterization of testimony. No useful purpose would be served by detailing them. We have examined the record and find that in each of the instances of which Ford complains, the argument was within the bounds of propriety. More importantly, having failed to object below, it was incumbent upon Ford to demonstrate that the claimed improprieties were such that a prompt objection and admonition to the jury would not have corrected the error. Ford has utterly failed to show that in any of the specific instances of claimed misconduct, an objection and admonition would not have remedied the situation. IV Instructions Ford complains of instructional errors on design defect and superseding cause. 119 Cal. App. 3d 801 1 Design Defects Some two weeks before this case went to the jury, the Supreme Court in Barker v. Lull Engineering Co. 1978 20 Cal. 3d 413 143 Cal. Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443, 96 A.L.R.3d 1, formulated the following twopronged definition of design defect, embodying the consumer expectation standard and riskbenefit test First, a product\n\nChunk 2 (relevance: 0.79):\nIn the case at bench, Ford failed to object to any of the matters of which it now complains during plaintiffs arguments to the jury. During Mr. Hews closing argument on behalf of plaintiff Grimshaw, which covers 100 pages of the reporters transcript, Ford did not interpose a single objection. Nor did Ford make any objection during Mr. Rabins closing argument on behalf of the Grays. During a recess Ford moved for a mistrial complaining of two matters to which Mr. Hews had referred during his argument His reference to Fords knowledge that death would result from defective and negligent design of the Pinto and his reference to a document prepared by Mr. Copp purporting to depict the crush area of the Pinto. The court denied the motion, noting that the reference to the document prepared by Mr. Copp but which had not been received in evidence was innocuous and that the reference to deaths as well as injuries was proper under the evidence. Significantly Ford does not now complain of the courts rulings in connection with its motion for a mistrial. Following Mr. Cox argument on behalf of Ford, Mr. Robinson made the rebuttal argument for plaintiff Grimshaw. Ford made two objections to Robinsons argument. Ford does not assign either of these two remarks by Mr. Robinson as error or misconduct on this appeal. Thus, none of the matters of which Ford now complains were matters to which an objection was interposed and a request for admonition made in the court below. Ford is, therefore, precluded from raising the contentions of misconduct unless they were such as could not have been cured by an admonition. 18 In assessing whether alleged misconduct could have been cured by admonition, a reviewing court must bear in mind the wide latitude accorded counsel\n\nChunk 3 (relevance: 0.77):\nhis guardian ad litem and the Grays sued Ford and others. Grimshaw was permitted to amend his complaint to seek punitive damages but the Grays motion to amend their complaint for a like purpose was denied. The cases were thereafter consolidated for trial. fn. 3 Grimshaws case was submitted to the jury on theories of negligence and strict liability the Grays case went to the jury only on the strict liability theory. Fords Appeal Ford seeks reversal of the judgment as a whole on the following grounds 1 Erroneous rulings relating to Mr. Copps testimony 2 other erroneous evidentiary rulings 3 prejudicial misconduct by plaintiffs counsel 4 instructional errors and 5 jury misconduct. On the issue of punitive damages, Ford contends that its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted because the punitive award was statutorily unauthorized and constitutionally invalid and on the further ground that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of malice or corporate responsibility for malice. Ford also seeks reversal of the punitive award for claimed instructional errors on malice and proof of malice as well as on the numerous grounds addressed to the judgment as a whole. Finally, Ford maintains that even if punitive damages were appropriate in this case, the amount of the award was so excessive as to require a new trial or further remittitur of the award.

It exhibited a conscious and callous disregard of public safety in order to maximize corporate profits. Fords selfevaluation of its conduct is based on a review of the evidence most favorable to it instead of on the basis of the evidence most favorable to the judgment.

Expand on important terms using synonyms or related concepts.\n    4. Consider the intent of the query (e.g., question, search, summarize).\n    5. Include terms that would work well with both keyword matching (BM25) and semantic search.\n    6. Prioritize nouns, verbs, and adjectives as they get higher weights in our system.\n    7.

Chunk 1 (relevance: 0.93):
Federal Emission Standards 15 Ford contends that plaintiffs counsel was guilty of misconduct in attempting to get before the jury the fact that Ford had doctored its records to show compliance with federal emission standards, a subject which Ford says was irrelevant to the integrity of the Pintos fuel system. The matter first came up during redirectexamination of Mr. Copp. When asked about his position relative to Fords compliance with the federal emission standards, Mr. Copp responded that Ford maintained two computer printouts, one of which was doctored to show compliance and was used to report that fact to the government, and that he had investigated this fraud and called it to the attention of Ford executives. He was then asked whether this situation resulted in criminal charges against Ford. Ford objected and moved for a mistrial. The objection was sustained but the motion for mistrial was denied and the jury was admonished to disregard the question. The second time the matter came up was during plaintiffs crossexamination of Mr. Tubben, Fords engineering expert, concerning Fords procedure in certifying compliance with federal regulations. He was asked whether Ford kept two files in order to pass federal emission standards. Objection and a motion for mistrial ensued. The court sustained the objection but denied the mistrial. The questions were arguably proper in both of the abovedescribed instances. Mr. Copps testimony concerning the emission control matter tended to rebut Fords evidence that Mr. Copp was fired for absenteeism and unsatisfactory performance. Crossexamination of Mr. Tubben on the subject of compliance with federal emission controls tended to impeach his testimony that the Pinto met all federal regulations. The court nevertheless sustained Fords objections to the questions, presumably on the basis that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed its probative value, but denied the

Chunk 2 (relevance: 0.79):
It refers to Mr. Hews statement that Mr. Copp testified that Ford engaged in costbenefit analyses and that there was plenty of documentation for it. Ford argues that the documentation referred to by Mr. Coppthe GrushSaunby Reportwas excluded from evidence so that the statement was improper. However, there was other documentation which illustrated the fact that cost considerations caused Ford to delay incorporating safety features in the fuel tank system of its cars despite the knowledge that there was a need for such improvements. Furthermore, Mr. Copp was permitted to testify that Ford did in fact engage in costbenefit analyses which balanced life and limb against corporate savings and profits. Ford assigns a number of other remarks by Grimshaws counsel as misstatements of the evidence or exaggerations or mischaracterization of testimony. No useful purpose would be served by detailing them. We have examined the record and find that in each of the instances of which Ford complains, the argument was within the bounds of propriety. More importantly, having failed to object below, it was incumbent upon Ford to demonstrate that the claimed improprieties were such that a prompt objection and admonition to the jury would not have corrected the error. Ford has utterly failed to show that in any of the specific instances of claimed misconduct, an objection and admonition would not have remedied the situation. IV Instructions Ford complains of instructional errors on design defect and superseding cause. 119 Cal. App. 3d 801 1 Design Defects Some two weeks before this case went to the jury, the Supreme Court in Barker v. Lull Engineering Co. 1978 20 Cal. 3d 413 143 Cal. Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443, 96 A.L.R.3d 1, formulated the following twopronged definition of design defect, embodying the consumer expectation standard and riskbenefit test First, a product

Chunk 3 (relevance: 0.78):
that the reason for his termination was not his safety views but unsatisfactory work and absenteeism. Plaintiffs thereafter introduced rehabilitating testimony. Mr. Copp was permitted to testify to his campaign for automotive safety during his entire period of employment with Ford, including a conversation he had with Henry Ford II on the subject, his testimony before a United States Senate Committee concerning the Chevrolet Corvairs unsafe design and his role in exposing Fords conduct in connection with the emission control program. Ford argues that but for the courts erroneous initial ruling and its consequent crossexamination on the reason for Mr. Copps retirement, the damaging rehabilitation evidence would not have come in. Since we find no error in the courts initial ruling and since Ford has not advanced any independent reason why the rehabilitating evidence should have been excluded, Fords complaint concerning the prejudicial nature of that evidence must be rejected. 3 Mr. Copps Testimony Concerning Matters Relied Upon in Forming His Opinion Ford complains that the court erroneously permitted Mr. Copp to testify on direct examination to the contents of the literature, reports and tests on which he relied in forming his opinions. Ford cites five such instances Testimony concerning examples of vehicles meeting a 50mileperhour moving barrier test without fuel tank rupture and fire testimony that field reports proved overtheaxle fuel tank position to be superior in design testimony about a proposal United States Steel Co. made to Ford concerning a bladder within a tank testimony that he based his opinion that a bladder within a tank was feasible in 1969 and 1970 on the fact that Ford had started testing such a device in 1967 and that United States Steel had successfully built such a tank that withstood up to 30milesperhour fixed barrier crash tests without puncturing and

The second time the matter came up was during plaintiffs crossexamination of Mr. Tubben, Fords engineering expert, concerning Fords procedure in certifying compliance with federal regulations. He was asked whether Ford kept two files in order to pass federal emission standards. Objection and a motion for mistrial ensued. The court sustained the objection but denied the mistrial. The questions were arguably proper in both of the abovedescribed instances. Mr. Copps testimony concerning the emission control matter tended to rebut Fords evidence that Mr. Copp was fired for absenteeism and unsatisfactory performance. Crossexamination of Mr. Tubben on the subject of compliance with federal emission controls tended to impeach his testimony that the Pinto met all federal regulations. The court nevertheless sustained Fords objections to the questions, presumably on the basis that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed its probative value, but denied the mistrial motions. We find no abuse of discretion in the courts ruling denying a mistrial. There were sufficient bases for the courts implied determination that the questions were not asked in bad faith and that the admonitions to the jury would avoid the harmful effect of the questions.

In denying both motions, the trial judge impliedly determined that the misconduct did not result in prejudice and that the verdict was not the result, in whole or in part, of the charged misconduct. 14 Such determinations by the trial court may not be disturbed on appeal unless they are patently wrong.

The matter first came up during redirectexamination of Mr. Copp. When asked about his position relative to Fords compliance with the federal emission standards, Mr. Copp responded that Ford maintained two computer printouts, one of which was doctored to show compliance and was used to report that fact to the government, and that he had investigated this fraud and called it to the attention of Ford executives. He was then asked whether this situation resulted in criminal charges against Ford. Ford objected and moved for a mistrial. The objection was sustained but the motion for mistrial was denied and the

Ford argues that the documentation referred to by Mr. Coppthe GrushSaunby Reportwas excluded from evidence so that the statement was improper. However, there was other documentation which illustrated the fact that cost considerations caused Ford to delay incorporating safety features in the fuel tank system of its cars despite the knowledge that there was a need for such improvements. Furthermore, Mr. Copp was permitted to testify that Ford did in fact engage in costbenefit analyses which balanced life and limb against corporate savings and profits. Ford assigns a number of other remarks by Grimshaws counsel as misstatements of the evidence or exaggerations or mischaracterization of testimony. No useful purpose would be served by detailing them. We have examined the record and find that in each of the instances of which Ford complains, the argument was within the bounds of propriety. More importantly, having failed to object below, it was incumbent upon Ford to demonstrate that the claimed improprieties were such that a prompt objection and admonition to the jury would not have corrected the error. Ford has utterly failed to show that in any of the specific instances of claimed misconduct, an objection and admonition would not have remedied the situation. IV Instructions Ford complains of instructional errors on design defect and superseding cause. 119 Cal. App. 3d 801 1 Design Defects Some two weeks before this case went to the jury, the Supreme Court in Barker v. Lull Engineering Co. 1978 20 Cal. 3d 413 143 Cal. Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443, 96 A.L.R.3d 1, formulated the following twopronged definition of design defect, embodying the consumer expectation standard and riskbenefit test First, a product\n\nChunk 3 (relevance: 0.78):\nthat the reason for his termination was not his safety views but unsatisfactory work and absenteeism. Plaintiffs thereafter introduced rehabilitating testimony. Mr. Copp was permitted to testify to his campaign for automotive safety during his entire period of employment with Ford, including a conversation he had with Henry Ford II on the subject, his testimony before a United States Senate Committee concerning the Chevrolet Corvairs unsafe design and his role in exposing Fords conduct in connection with the emission control program. Ford argues that but for the courts erroneous initial ruling and its consequent crossexamination on the reason for Mr. Copps retirement, the damaging rehabilitation evidence would not have come in. Since we find no error in the courts initial ruling and since Ford has not advanced any independent reason why the rehabilitating evidence should have been excluded, Fords complaint concerning the prejudicial nature of that evidence must be rejected. 3 Mr. Copps Testimony Concerning Matters Relied Upon in Forming His Opinion Ford complains that the court erroneously permitted Mr. Copp to testify on direct examination to the contents of the literature, reports and tests on which he relied in forming his opinions. Ford cites five such instances Testimony concerning examples of vehicles meeting a 50mileperhour moving barrier test without fuel tank rupture and fire testimony that field reports proved overtheaxle fuel tank position to be superior in design testimony about a proposal United States Steel Co. made to Ford concerning a bladder within a tank testimony that he based his opinion that a bladder within a tank was feasible in 1969 and 1970 on the fact that Ford had started testing such a device in 1967 and that United States Steel had successfully built such a tank that withstood up to 30milesperhour fixed barrier crash tests without puncturing and\n\nChunk 4 (relevance: 0.77):\njury was admonished to disregard the question.

It uses a weighted combination of BM25 scores and cosine similarity of embeddings.\n    4. The search considers entities, key phrases, and dates from the text metadata.\n    5. Query terms are weighted based on their part of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives have higher weights).\n\n    Guidelines for creating an optimized query:\n    1. Identify and include key concepts from the original query.\n    2. Use relevant entities, key phrases, and dates from the metadata if applicable.\n    3. Expand on important terms using synonyms or related concepts.\n    4. Consider the intent of the query (e.g., question, search, summarize).\n    5. Include terms that would work well with both keyword matching (BM25) and semantic search.\n    6. Prioritize nouns, verbs, and adjectives as they get higher weights in our system.\n    7. Ensure the optimized query is concise but comprehensive.\n    8. Format the optimized query as a single string, ready for search.\n\n    Optimized Query:\n    '}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'max_tokens': 500}}

portions of his body. Because Ford does not contest the amount of compensatory damages awarded to Grimshaw and the Grays, no purpose would be served by further description of the injuries suffered by Grimshaw or the damages sustained by the Grays. Design of the Pinto Fuel System In 1968, Ford began designing a new subcompact automobile which ultimately became the Pinto. Mr. Iacocca, then a Ford vice president, conceived the project and was its moving force. Fords objective was to build a car at or below 2,000 pounds to sell for no more than 2,000. Ordinarily marketing surveys and preliminary engineering studies precede the styling of a new automobile line. Pinto, however, was a rush project, so that styling preceded engineering and dictated engineering design to a greater degree than usual. Among the engineering decisions dictated by styling was the placement of the fuel tank. It was then the preferred practice in Europe and Japan to locate the gas tank over the rear axle in subcompacts because a small vehicle has less crush space between the rear axle and the bumper than larger cars. The Pintos styling, however, required the tank to be placed behind the rear axle leaving only 9 or 10 inches of crush spacefar less than in any other American automobile or Ford overseas subcompact. In addition, the Pinto was designed so that its bumper was little more than a chrome strip, less substantial than the bumper of any other American car produced then or later. The Pintos rear structure also lacked reinforcing members known as hat sections two longitudinal side members and horizontal crossmembers running between them such as were found in cars of larger unitized construction and in all automobiles produced by Fords overseas operations. The absence of the reinforcing members rendered the Pinto less

his guardian ad litem and the Grays sued Ford and others. Grimshaw was permitted to amend his complaint to seek punitive damages but the Grays motion to amend their complaint for a like purpose was denied. The cases were thereafter consolidated for trial. fn. 3 Grimshaws case was submitted to the jury on theories of negligence and strict liability the Grays case went to the jury only on the strict liability theory. Fords Appeal Ford seeks reversal of the judgment as a whole on the following grounds 1 Erroneous rulings relating to Mr. Copps testimony 2 other erroneous evidentiary rulings 3 prejudicial misconduct by plaintiffs counsel 4 instructional errors and 5 jury misconduct. On the issue of punitive damages, Ford contends that its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted because the punitive award was statutorily unauthorized and constitutionally invalid and on the further ground that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of malice or corporate responsibility for malice. Ford also seeks reversal of the punitive award for claimed instructional errors on malice and proof of malice as well as on the numerous grounds addressed to the judgment as a whole. Finally, Ford maintains that even if punitive damages were appropriate in this case, the amount of the award was so excessive as to require a new trial or further remittitur of the award. In the ensuing analysis ad nauseam of Fords wideranging assault on the judgment, we have concluded that Ford has failed to demonstrate that any errors or irregularities occurred during the trial which resulted in a miscarriage of justice requiring reversal. I The Testimony of Harley Copp Mr. Harley Copp, a former Ford engineering executive, was plaintiffs principal witness on the subject of defects in the design, placement, and protection of the

Chunk 3 (relevance: 0.74):
It refers to Mr. Hews statement that Mr. Copp testified that Ford engaged in costbenefit analyses and that there was plenty of documentation for it. Ford argues that the documentation referred to by Mr. Coppthe GrushSaunby Reportwas excluded from evidence so that the statement was improper. However, there was other documentation which illustrated the fact that cost considerations caused Ford to delay incorporating safety features in the fuel tank system of its cars despite the knowledge that there was a need for such improvements. Furthermore, Mr. Copp was permitted to testify that Ford did in fact engage in costbenefit analyses which balanced life and limb against corporate savings and profits. Ford assigns a number of other remarks by Grimshaws counsel as misstatements of the evidence or exaggerations or mischaracterization of testimony. No useful purpose would be served by detailing them. We have examined the record and find that in each of the instances of which Ford complains, the argument was within the bounds of propriety. More importantly, having failed to object below, it was incumbent upon Ford to demonstrate that the claimed improprieties were such that a prompt objection and admonition to the jury would not have corrected the error. Ford has utterly failed to show that in any of the specific instances of claimed misconduct, an objection and admonition would not have remedied the situation. IV Instructions Ford complains of instructional errors on design defect and superseding cause. 119 Cal.

Fords management was reprehensible in the extreme. It exhibited a conscious and callous disregard of public safety in order to maximize corporate profits. Fords selfevaluation of its conduct is based on a review of the evidence most favorable to it instead of on the basis of the evidence most favorable to the judgment. Unlike malicious conduct directed 119 Cal. App. 3d 820 toward a single specific individual, Fords tortious conduct endangered the lives of thousands of Pinto purchasers. Weighed against the factor of reprehensibility, the punitive damage award as reduced by the trial judge was not excessive. Nor was the reduced award excessive taking into account defendants wealth and the size of the compensatory award. Fords net worth was 7.7 billion and its income after taxes for 1976 was over 983 million. The punitive award was approximately .005 percent of Fords net worth and approximately .03 percent of its 1976 net income. The ratio of the punitive damages to compensatory damages was approximately 1.4 to 1. Significantly, Ford does not quarrel with the amount of the compensatory award to Grimshaw. Nor was the size of the award excessive in light of its deterrent purpose. An award which is so small that it can be simply written off as a part of the cost of doing business would have no deterrent effect. An award which affects the companys pricing of its product and thereby affects its competitive advantage would serve as a deterrent. SeeNeal v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, supra, 21 Cal. 3d 910, 929, fn. 14. The award in question was far from excessive as a deterrent against future wrongful conduct by Ford and others. Ford complains that the punitive award is far greater than the maximum penalty that may be imposed under California or federal law prohibiting the sale of

states in part The 20 and 30 mph rear fixed barrier crashes will probably require repackaging the fuel tanks in a protected area such as above the rear axle. This is based on moving barrier crash tests of a Chevelle and a Ford at 30 mph and other Ford products at 20 mph. Currently there are no plans for forward models to repackage the fuel tanks. Tests must be conducted to prove that repackaged tanks will live without significantly strengthening rear structure for added protection. The report also notes that the Pinto was the smallest car line with most difficulty in achieving compliance.It is reasonable to infer that the report was prepared for and known to Ford officials in policymaking positions. 119 Cal. App. 3d 778 The fact that two of the crash tests were run at the request of the Ford chassis and vehicle engineering department for the specific purpose of demonstrating the advisability of moving the fuel tank over the axle as a possible fix further corroborated Mr. Copps testimony that management knew the results of the crash tests. Mr. Kennedy, who succeeded Mr. Copp as the engineer in charge of Fords crash testing program, admitted that the test results had been forwarded up the chain of command to his superiors. Finally, Mr. Copp testified to conversations in late 1968 or early 1969 with the chief assistant research engineer in charge of costweight evaluation of the Pinto, and to a later conversation with the chief chassis engineer who was then in charge of crash testing the early prototype. In these conversations, both men expressed concern about the integrity of the Pintos fuel system and complained about managements unwillingness to deviate from the design if the change would cost money. 119 Cal.

An award which is so small that it can be simply written off as a part of the cost of doing business would have no deterrent effect. An award which affects the companys pricing of its product and thereby affects its competitive advantage would serve as a deterrent. SeeNeal v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, supra, 21 Cal. 3d 910, 929, fn. 14. The award in question was far from excessive as a deterrent against future wrongful conduct by Ford and others. Ford complains that the punitive award is far greater than the maximum penalty that may be imposed under California or federal law prohibiting the sale of\n\nChunk 5 (relevance: 0.72):\nstates in part The 20 and 30 mph rear fixed barrier crashes will probably require repackaging the fuel tanks in a protected area such as above the rear axle. This is based on moving barrier crash tests of a Chevelle and a Ford at 30 mph and other Ford products at 20 mph. Currently there are no plans for forward models to repackage the fuel tanks. Tests must be conducted to prove that repackaged tanks will live without significantly strengthening rear structure for added protection. The report also notes that the Pinto was the smallest car line with most difficulty in achieving compliance.It is reasonable to infer that the report was prepared for and known to Ford officials in policymaking positions. 119 Cal. App. 3d 778 The fact that two of the crash tests were run at the request of the Ford chassis and vehicle engineering department for the specific purpose of demonstrating the advisability of moving the fuel tank over the axle as a possible fix further corroborated Mr. Copps testimony that management knew the results of the crash tests. Mr. Kennedy, who succeeded Mr. Copp as the engineer in charge of Fords crash testing program, admitted that the test results had been forwarded up the chain of command to his superiors. Finally, Mr. Copp testified to conversations in late 1968 or early 1969 with the chief assistant research engineer in charge of costweight evaluation of the Pinto, and to a later conversation with the chief chassis engineer who was then in charge of crash testing the early prototype. In these conversations, both men expressed concern about the integrity of the Pintos fuel system and complained about managements unwillingness to deviate from the design if the change would cost money. 119 Cal.
